we need to sell a lifestyle instead of just clothing.

main reason people buy clothing is because they need a certain lifestyle instead of just clothes.

instead of just taking random Facebook and Instagram photos that show out clothes, we SELL the FEELING of wearing them clothes, a lifestyle is what we sell.

when we look at our niche.

do we make clothes for farmers? if yes? then

we make content & videos about farmers, field workers, strength and countryside.

if we make clothes for music fans? then

we make content and videos around being at concerts, use viral songs related to clothes, wear clothes in parties.
