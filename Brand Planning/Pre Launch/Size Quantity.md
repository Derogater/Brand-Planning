More Sizes means more Bulk order spending and less quantity for every other size. Sizes L and M are most Common so these should be the highest amount of orders that we should place & also stagger(lessen) the quantify in both directions accordingly to the data(sale data).

i prefer using a 2-3-6-4 ratio (S:M:L:XL) or a 2-2-4-4 ratio as a general guideline for a Pack of Item.

Let's say i ordered a lot of Pieces 15 for Cobalt Color item (T-Shirt) then i would expect to have  (S:M:L:XL) 2-3-6-4 pieces according to there sizes.
