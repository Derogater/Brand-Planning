Nobody likes a salesman who says 'Hey! Buy this thing,' as soon as you open the door.  
  
So, how would the audience react if our content is all about spilling out the diary and saying, 'Hey! Do this, do this, do this,'  
  
Right?  
  
But Muqadas, isn’t it good to share actionable tips?  
  
It’s great, man. You can post anything you want.  
  
But the question is: how's it different from your competitors?  
  
How does it make them remember the content?  
  
So rather than making your content all about tips and hacks, tell them what they're doing to get [x] wrong and here's why it's wrong.  
  
You'll call out the ideal audience from their homes when your content reaches them.

1. THEY WANTS TO BE AWARE.

AWARE OF THERE PROBLEMS, AWARE OF THERE MISTAKES.

2. WHEN THEY DON'T BUY

IF OUR CONTENT IS ONLY ABOUT SPILLING OUT THE ITEMS AND SAYING:

"HERE ARE 10 TIPS TO DO [X]."
"HEY, RATHER THEN [X], DO THIS, THIS, AND THIS."

3. HOW TO MAKE PEOPLE PAY

THESE TYPES OF EDUCATIONS MIGHT WORK FOR BEING CALLED AN EXPERT OF THE INDUSTRY, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT MAKES PEOPLE PAY.

WHEN IT COMES TO ATTRACTING THE PEOPLE WHO EARN MORE THEN US, THE GOAL IS TO LET THEM KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DING TO ACHIEVE [X] OS WRONG AND WHY IT'S WRONG.
