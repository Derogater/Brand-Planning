The concept of selling like an A-brand, particularly through the lens of “Experience Design,” is about focusing marketing efforts on creating and selling an experience rather than just a product.  
  
This approach is well-illustrated by the film footage reference to a Jaguar pitch in “Mad Men,” where the allure of the car is not solely its technical specs but the lifestyle and prestige it embodies.  
  
Key Elements of Experience Design in Selling:  
  
Selling the Experience Over the Product: The core idea is to shift the focus from what the product is to what the product enables the consumer to feel or experience. For a brand like Jaguar, it’s not just about selling a car; it’s about selling the luxury, freedom, and status that comes with owning a Jaguar.  
  
Emotion and Lifestyle: The focus is on tapping into the emotions of potential buyers and connecting the product to a desirable lifestyle. This emotional connection can make the product more appealing and can drive purchase decisions more effectively than technical details.  
  
Prestige: Brands like Jaguar sell not just a vehicle but a symbol of success and elite status. The marketing strategies of such brands often highlight the prestige associated with their products, making them inspirational.  
  
Influence of Designers: Designers like Virgil Abloh (Off-White, Louis Vuitton) and Coco Chanel have mastered the art of experience design, blending their products seamlessly into lifestyles and narratives that resonate with their target audience. Similarly, brands like Nike create more than just sportswear; they sell an active, healthy, and dynamic lifestyle.  
In summary, selling like an A-brand through experience design means moving beyond the tangible aspects of the product to sell a lifestyle, an emotion, and a status that resonates deeply with the consumer’s aspirations and desires. This approach not only differentiates the brand in a crowded market but also fosters a deeper connection with its audience.
