1. SOMETIMES THE MOST PRODUCTIVE THING WE CAN DO IS REST AND RESTORE OUR ENERGY
2. IN CASE OF EMERGENCY, BREAK THE ROUTINE.
3. DON'T COMPARE YOURSELF TO ANYONE ELSE. YOUR AUTHENTICITY IS YOUR CURRENCY.
4. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A MISTAKE. MISTAKES ARE THE PORTALS TO UNEXPECTED SOLUTIONS.
5. SUCCESS IS BASED ON THE INNER FULFILLMENT, NOT EXTERNAL VALIDATION.
6. EXPECTATIONS ARE THE ENEMY OF CREATIVITY. GIVE YOUR ART THE FREEDOM TO BECOME WHATEVER IT WANTS TO BE.
7. OUR ART WILL OUTLIVE US, CREATE ACCORDINGLY.
