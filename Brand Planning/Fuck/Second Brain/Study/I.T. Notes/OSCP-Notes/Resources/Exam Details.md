## Exam Rules & Restrictions

### Restrictions on Tools

In summary, commercial tools, automatic exploitation tools, and mass scanning tools are forbidden.

**One use** of Metasploit is allowed. However, utility such as the metasploit handler module and the msfvenom payload generator have no limitations on use. **Auxiliary** modules are also limited, such as scanners.

Some common tools such as LinPEAS have caused issues in the past with automatic exploitation features - the [updated version](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/issues/125) of LinPEAS is now OSCP-friendly, but Offsec will make no exceptions in future.
