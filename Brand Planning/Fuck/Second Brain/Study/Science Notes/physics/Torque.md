> The [[notebook-main/physics/Force]] that makes an object rotate

$$ \tau = r \cdot F sin \theta $$

r: radius of object
F: [[notebook-main/physics/Force]] applied
theta: angle of force relative to the radius

Similar to Newton's Second Law,
$$ \tau = I \alpha $$

I: [[notebook-main/physics/Moment of Inertia]]
alpha: [[angular acceleration]]
