> How the frequency of a wave changes as the observer moves relative to the source

$$ f' = \dfrac{v \pm v_o}{v \mp v_s} f_0 $$
$f'$ = observed frequency
$v$ = speed of [[notebook-main/physics/Sound]]
$v_o$ = observer's [[notebook-main/physics/Velocity]]
$v_s$ = source velocity
$f_0$ = source frequency
