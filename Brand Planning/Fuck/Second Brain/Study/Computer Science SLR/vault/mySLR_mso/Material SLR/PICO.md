PICO is a framework for formulating research questions and inclusion/ exclusion criteria for literature reviews. PICO stands for:

- **Population**: The group of interest or the target audience for the research question. For example, computer science students, software developers, or artificial intelligence researchers.
- **Intervention**: The action, process, or phenomenon that is being investigated or compared. For example, a programming language, a software tool, or an algorithm.
- **Comparison**: The alternative or control condition that is used as a reference or benchmark for the intervention. For example, another programming language, a different software tool, or a baseline algorithm.
- **Outcome**: The result, effect, or impact that is measured or observed from the intervention and the comparison. For example, learning outcomes, productivity, performance, or creativity.

Using Obsidian, you can create notes for each component of PICO and link them to your research question note using the `[[` and `]]` syntax. You can also use tags or headings to label your notes with PICO categories. This will help you structure your research question and your inclusion/ exclusion criteria for literature review. You can also use the graph view or other plugins to visualize and analyze the relationships between your PICO notes and your literature sources.

### PICO case study:

- **Population**: Software developers who use GitHub for collaborative projects.
- **Intervention**: A recommender system that suggests relevant code snippets from GitHub repositories.
- **Comparison**: No recommender system or a baseline recommender system that uses keyword matching.
- **Outcome**: The quality, efficiency, and satisfaction of software development tasks.

The research question based on this PICO example is: How does a recommender system that suggests relevant code snippets from GitHub repositories affect the quality, efficiency, and satisfaction of software development tasks for software developers who use GitHub for collaborative projects?

The inclusion and exclusion criteria for literature review based on this PICO example are:

- **Inclusion criteria**:
    - Studies that evaluate the effectiveness of recommender systems for software development tasks.
    - Studies that use GitHub repositories as the source of code snippets.
    - Studies that measure the quality, efficiency, and satisfaction of software development tasks.
    - Studies that are published in peer-reviewed journals or conferences in the last five years.
- **Exclusion criteria**:
    - Studies that do not involve recommender systems for software development tasks.
    - Studies that use other sources of code snippets besides GitHub repositories.
    - Studies that do not measure the quality, efficiency, and satisfaction of software development tasks.
    - Studies that are not published in peer-reviewed journals or conferences or are older than five years.
