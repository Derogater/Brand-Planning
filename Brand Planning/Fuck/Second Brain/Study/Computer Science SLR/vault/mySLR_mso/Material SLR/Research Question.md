A template for a research question for a systematic literature review in computer science is:

**What is the [effect/impact/relationship] of [intervention/phenomenon] on [outcome/variable] in [population/context]?**

For example, based on the article , the research question could be:

**What is the effect of a recommender system that suggests relevant code snippets from GitHub repositories on the quality, efficiency, and satisfaction of software development tasks for software developers who use GitHub for collaborative projects?**

This template follows the [[PICO]] framework, which stands for Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome. PICO helps to define the scope and aims of the systematic literature review, as well as the inclusion and exclusion criteria for selecting relevant literature.
