To define your research question and inclusion/exclusion criteria for selecting relevant literature in Obsidian, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new note in Obsidian with a descriptive title for your research question. For example, “How does artificial intelligence affect human creativity?”.
2. Write down your research question in the note, and explain why it is important, relevant, and feasible to answer. You can also include some background information or context for your question.
3. Use the `[[` and `]]` syntax to create links to other notes that are related to your research question. For example, you can link to notes about artificial intelligence, human creativity, or previous studies on the topic. This will help you organize your notes and see the connections between them in the graph view.
4. Create another note with a title like “Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria for Literature Review”. In this note, you will specify the types of studies, participants, interventions, comparators, and outcomes that you will include or exclude in your literature review. You can use bullet points, tables, or diagrams to present your criteria clearly and logically. You can also link to your research question note using the `[[` and `]]` syntax.
5. Use the search function in Obsidian to find relevant literature for your research question. You can use keywords, tags, or filters to narrow down your search results. You can also use plugins like Dataview or Kanban to query and display your data in different ways.
6. For each literature source that you find, create a new note with a summary, evaluation, and citation of the source. You can use the `![[` and `]]` syntax to embed the source file in your note, if you have it stored in your vault. You can also link to your inclusion and exclusion criteria note to check if the source meets your criteria.
7. Use the graph view, canvas, or other plugins to visualize and analyze the relationships between your literature sources and your research question. You can also use the backlinks pane to see which notes link to each other. This will help you identify gaps, patterns, or themes in your literature review.
