In this stage, only the title and abstract of the selected papers will be analyzed. The suggestion is to export a CVS file (Jabref has this functionality) with the articles' data (with the duplicates removed) and to import it into a worksheet (for example, from Google Drive).

The data that will be analyzed in this step (stored in the generated worksheet) is only title and abstract. It is interesting to add a status column so that each researcher involved in this step can assign one of the following values to the analyzed article: Included, excluded or doubtful (According to the defined inclusion / exclusion criteria - see step 8). Each of the researchers will have their own column to put the result of their analysis. It is important to highlight which analysis should be based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria defined previously. This step is quite subjective. Articles that are marked "doubtful" should be discussed by team members, as well as possible disagreements. If those involved do not reach agreement, a diagonal reading of the paper is suggested to resolve the doubt. It is suggested that the first author does the first screening, followed by the others involved. All papers selected in this step should be downloaded. It is suggested to make the papers available to anyone involved in any cloud service (e.g. Dropbox)
