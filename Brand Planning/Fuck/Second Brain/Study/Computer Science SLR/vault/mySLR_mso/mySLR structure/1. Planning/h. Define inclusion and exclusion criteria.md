In this step the criteria to decide which papers will go to the next stage of the review will be defined. The criteria should be defined from the research questions (see [[a. Defining main research]]). 

Other criteria that may be used are: 
1. Restriction by language (only articles in English)
2. Restriction by area
3. Restriction by primary articles (excluding secondary studies such as other systematic reviews, area mapping and surveys), etc. 

The criteria, especially those of exclusion, may contain restrictions regarding the type of research that one wishes to do. These criteria should be carefully defined and reviewed by your advisor before they are implemented in order to align them with the research aims.
