  {"id":"abbasBlockchainBasedAuthenticationInternet2021","abstract":"Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has emerged as an advancement over the traditional Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) towards achieving a more efficient intelligent transportation system that is capable of providing various intelligent services and supporting different applications for the drivers and passengers on roads. In order for the IoV and VANETs environments to be able to offer such beneficial road services, huge amounts of data are generated and exchanged among the different communicated entities in these vehicular networks wirelessly via open channels, which could attract the adversaries and threaten the network with several possible types of security attacks. In this survey, we target the authentication part of the security system while highlighting the efficiency of blockchains in the IoV and VANETs environments. First, a detailed background on IoV and blockchain is provided, followed by a wide range of security requirements, challenges, and possible attacks in vehicular networks. Then, a more focused review is provided on the recent blockchain-based authentication schemes in IoV and VANETs with a detailed comparative study in terms of techniques used, network models, evaluation tools, and attacks counteracted. Lastly, some future challenges for IoV security are discussed that are necessary to be addressed in the upcoming research.","author":[{"family":"Abbas","given":"Sohail"},{"family":"Abu Talib","given":"Manar"},{"family":"Ahmed","given":"Afaf"},{"family":"Khan","given":"Faheem"},{"family":"Ahmad","given":"Shabir"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Do-Hyeun"}],"citation-key":"abbasBlockchainBasedAuthenticationInternet2021","container-title":"SENSORS","DOI":"10.3390/s21237927","issue":"23","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,12]]},"title":"Blockchain-Based Authentication in Internet of Vehicles: A Survey","type":"article-journal","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"abdmeziemNodesSelectionReview2023","abstract":"Internet of Things (IoT) gained momentum these last few years pushed by the emergence of fast and reliable communication networks such as 5G and beyond. IoT depends on collecting information from the environment, leading to a significant increase in the amount of data generated that needs to be transmitted, saved, and analyzed. It is clear that classical deterministic approaches might not be suitable to this complex and fast evolving environment. Hence, machine learning techniques with their ability to handle such a dynamic context, are rising in popularity. In particular, Federated Learning architectures which are better suited to the distributed nature of IoT and its privacy concerns. Besides, to address security risks such as model poisoning, device compromise, and network interception, Blockchain (BC) is seen as the secure and distributed underlying communication infrastructure of choice. This integration of IoT, FL, and BC remains in its early stages and several challenges arise. Indeed, nodes selection to perform resource intensive and critical operations like model learning and transactions validation is a crucial issue considering the strong heterogeneity of the involved devices in terms of resources. In this paper, we propose an original literature review including a taxonomy, a thorough analysis, a comparison of the proposed approaches, along with some open research directions.","author":[{"family":"Abdmeziem","given":"Mohammed Riyadh"},{"family":"Akli","given":"Hiba"},{"family":"Zourane","given":"Rima"}],"citation-key":"abdmeziemNodesSelectionReview2023","container-title":"SECURITY AND PRIVACY","DOI":"10.1002/spy2.344","ISSN":"2475-6725","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,9,28]]},"title":"Nodes selection review for federated learning in the blockchain-based internet of things","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"abdulkareemFIPCAIoTNetwork2022","abstract":"Intrusion detection systems (IDS) protect networks by continuously monitoring data flow and taking immediate action when anomalies are detected. However, due to redundancy and significant network data correlation, classical IDS have shortcomings such as poor detection rates and high computational complexity. This paper proposes a novel feature selection and extraction technique (FI-PCA). Feature Importance (FI) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are used to preprocess the network dataset (PCA). FI identifies the most important features in the data, while PCA is used to reduce dimensionality and denoise the data. In order to detect anomalies, we employ three single classifiers: Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. Preliminary results, however, show that these classifiers have achieved average classification metric scores. On this basis, we use the Stack Ensemble Learning Classifier (ELC) method of combining single classifiers to improve the classifier's performance further. Experimental results on varied feature dimensions of an IoT (Bot-IoT) dataset indicate that our proposed technique combined with the Stack ELC can maintain the same level of classification performance for reduced dataset features. A comparison of our result with state-of-the-art classifiers’ classification performance shows that our classifier is superior in terms of accuracy and detection rate. At the same time, a remarkable decrease is recorded for both training and test time.","author":[{"family":"Abdulkareem","given":"Sulyman Age"},{"family":"Foh","given":"Chuan Heng"},{"family":"Carrez","given":"François"},{"family":"Moessner","given":"Klaus"}],"citation-key":"abdulkareemFIPCAIoTNetwork2022","container-title":"2022 International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications (ISNCC)","DOI":"10.1109/ISNCC55209.2022.9851723","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,7]]},"page":"1-6","title":"FI-PCA for IoT Network Intrusion Detection","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"abegazBlockchainBasedResourceTrading2023","abstract":"With the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), mobile devices (MDs) and their demands for low-latency data communication are increasing. Due to the limited resources of MDs, such as energy, computation, storage, and bandwidth, IIoT systems cannot meet MDs' quality of service (QoS) and security requirements. Recently, UAVs have been deployed as aerial base stations in the IIoT network to provide connectivity and share resources with MDs. We consider a resource trading environment where multiple resource providers compete to sell their resources to MDs and maximize their profit by continually adjusting their pricing strategies. Multiple MDs, on the other hand, interact with the environment to make purchasing decisions based on the prices set by resource providers to reduce costs and improve QoS. We propose a novel intelligent resource trading framework that integrates multi-agent deep reinforcement Learning (MADRL), blockchain, and game theory to manage dynamic resource trading environments. A consortium blockchain with a smart contract is deployed to ensure the security and privacy of the resource transactions. We formulated the optimization problem using a Stackelberg game. However, the formulated optimization problem in the multi-agent IIoT environment is complex and dynamic, making it difficult to solve directly. Thus, we transform it into a stochastic game to solve the dynamics of the optimization problem. We propose a dynamic pricing algorithm that combines the Stackelberg game with the MADRL algorithm to solve the formulated stochastic game. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme outperforms others to improve resource trading in UAV-assisted IIoT networks.","author":[{"family":"Abegaz","given":"Mohammed Seid"},{"family":"Abishu","given":"Hayla Nahom"},{"family":"Yacob","given":"Yasin Habtamu"},{"family":"Ayall","given":"Tewodros Alemu"},{"family":"Erbad","given":"Aiman"},{"family":"Guizani","given":"Mohsen"}],"citation-key":"abegazBlockchainBasedResourceTrading2023","container-title":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORK AND SERVICE MANAGEMENT","DOI":"10.1109/TNSM.2022.3197309","ISSN":"1932-4537","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,3]]},"page":"166-181","title":"Blockchain-Based Resource Trading in Multi-UAV-Assisted Industrial IoT Networks: A Multi-Agent DRL Approach","type":"article-journal","volume":"20"},
  {"id":"abideenDigitalTwinIntegrated2021","abstract":"Background: As the Internet of Things (IoT) has become more prevalent in recent years, digital twins have attracted a lot of attention. A digital twin is a virtual representation that replicates a physical object or process over a period of time. These tools directly assist in reducing the manufacturing and supply chain lead time to produce a lean, flexible, and smart production and supply chain setting. Recently, reinforced machine learning has been introduced in production and logistics systems to build prescriptive decision support platforms to create a combination of lean, smart, and agile production setup. Therefore, there is a need to cumulatively arrange and systematize the past research done in this area to get a better understanding of the current trend and future research directions from the perspective of Industry 4.0. Methods: Strict keyword selection, search strategy, and exclusion criteria were applied in the Scopus database (2010 to 2021) to systematize the literature. Results: The findings are snowballed as a systematic review and later the final data set has been conducted to understand the intensity and relevance of research work done in different subsections related to the context of the research agenda proposed. Conclusion: A framework for data-driven digital twin generation and reinforced learning has been proposed at the end of the paper along with a research paradigm.","author":[{"family":"Abideen","given":"Ahmed Zainul"},{"family":"Sundram","given":"Veera Pandiyan Kaliani"},{"family":"Pyeman","given":"Jaafar"},{"family":"Othman","given":"Abdul Kadir"},{"family":"Sorooshian","given":"Shahryar"}],"citation-key":"abideenDigitalTwinIntegrated2021","container-title":"LOGISTICS-BASEL","DOI":"10.3390/logistics5040084","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,12]]},"title":"Digital Twin Integrated Reinforced Learning in Supply Chain and Logistics","type":"article-journal","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"ahamadRoleBlockChain2022","abstract":"The most well-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is the one for which blockchain technology was created. A cryptocurrency is a digital means of exchange that uses encryption techniques to manage the creation of monetary units and verify the transfer of funds. A blockchain is a decentralised ledger that records all peer-to-peer transactions. Blockchain is also recognised as the protocol of trust. This security concept uses decentralisation to establish a global index of all financial transactions that occur in a distinct network and makes them absolute.Blockchain technology establishes trust and harmony in direct communication between two parties without the involvement of a third party. Participants can confirm transactions without the requirement for a central clearing authority using this technology. Third-party trusted intermediaries have a character for triggering transaction delays. There would be speedier reconciliation between transacting parties and participants if such intermediaries were not present. In addition, the Internet of Things is a new technology that allows virtual and physical items to link and communicate with one another, resulting in the creation of new digitised services. When the number of devices connected through an IoT network grows. However, this data is not encrypted; it does not provide privacy.In this regard, blockchain technology might give massive benefits because it can quickly secure the anonymity of the obtained data. Furthermore, Blockchain can assist in solving most of the security vulnerabilities and traceability concerns in financial transactions by keeping track of how devices interact.In this state, they are, and how they transact with other IoT devices. A blockchain is hack-resistant and has a low danger of being hacked to improve data security.This article aims to explain the structure and operation of Blockchain and IoT in the context of securing financial transactions in the cryptocurrency market.Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

  {"id":"ahmadIonizingRadiationMonitoring2021","abstract":"As nuclear technology evolves, and continues to be used in various fields since its discovery less than a century ago, radiation safety has become a major concern to humans and the environment. Radiation monitoring plays a significant role in preventive radiological nuclear detection in nuclear facilities, hospitals, or in any activities associated with radioactive materials by acting as a tool to measure the risk of being exposed to radiation while reaping its benefit. Apart from in occupational settings, radiation monitoring is required in emergency responses to radiation incidents as well as outdoor radiation zones. Several radiation sensors have been developed, ranging from as simple as a Geiger-Muller counter to bulkier radiation systems such as the High Purity Germanium detector, with different functionality for use in different settings, but the inability to provide real-time data makes radiation monitoring activities less effective. The deployment of manned vehicles equipped with these radiation sensors reduces the scope of radiation monitoring operations significantly, but the safety of radiation monitoring operators is still compromised. Recently, the Internet of Things (IoT) technology has been introduced to the world and offered solutions to these limitations. This review elucidates a systematic understanding of the fundamental usage of the Internet of Drones for radiation monitoring purposes. The extension of essential functional blocks in IoT can be expanded across radiation monitoring industries, presenting several emerging research opportunities and challenges. This article offers a comprehensive review of the evolutionary application of IoT technology in nuclear and radiation monitoring.

A person entering into the field of blockchain is faced with the issue of which blockchain surveys to read and why?, Who is publishing these surveys and what is the nature of these surveys?, Which of the publishers are publishing more such surveys and what are the lengths of the published surveys?, Which kind of survey is getting more citations?, Which of the authors is collaborating on such surveys?, etc. All these questions motivated us to analyze the trends in publishing blockchain surveys. In this paper, we have performed a bibliometric analysis on 1088 surveys and review papers published in the field of blockchain in the last six years. We have analyzed the papers with respect to the publication type, publishers and venue, references, citations, paper length, different categories, year, countries, authors, and their collaborations and found interesting insights. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first of its kind and hope to provide better understanding of the field.","author":[{"family":"Ahmad","given":"Hira"},{"family":"Ahsan","given":"Muhammad Ahtazaz"},{"family":"Mian","given":"Adnan Noor"}],"citation-key":"ahmadTrendsPublishingBlockchain2023","container-title":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY","DOI":"10.1007/s10207-022-00653-z","ISSN":"1615-5262","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,4]]},"page":"511-523","title":"Trends in publishing blockchain surveys: a bibliometric perspective","type":"article-journal","volume":"22"},

IIoT-enabled technologies have been reviewed and implemented in several research, but more research into the opportunities and challenges they present is necessary. This paper explores IIoT-enabled technologies and infrastructure, their role in global industrial growth, applications, challenges, and future directions. IIoT applications use the intelligence of things to solve industrial problems like supply chain mismanagement, data privacy risks, a weak cloud strategy, cost containment, and others. For instance, fog computing reduces parking, platform, fuel, and CO2 emissions. A blockchain-based security framework for the cement sector can resolve 51% of security issues and Sybil attacks caused by consensus algorithms like Proof of Work (PoW). Major companies' performance depends on well-designed IIoT infrastructure, despite significant challenges.

  {"id":"ahmedMachineLearningBased2022","abstract":"Security is a major concern for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Due to their vulnerabilities, these devices are an easy target for unauthorized access. Traditional security mechanisms are not easily deployed on these tiny devices. Therefore, machine learning-based algorithms are proving to be key enablers in IoT attack detection. In this paper, we critically investigate the efficacy of classification algorithms; Logistic Regression (LR), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors KNN), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) for malicious attack detection in an IoT network flow traffic. A real-time heterogeneous dataset is used in this study. The data is preprocessed before experimentation. In addition, a feature selection method is implemented to identify the most important features. Furthermore, we evaluate the classifiers using accuracy, precision, recall, and Fl-score. The results on binary classification are comparable with the state-of-the-art in this domain. The tree-based classifiers outperform LR and GNB with 99% accuracy and a 0.99 Fl-score. It is observed that the LR and GNB are not the best choices for multiclass classification. However, DT, KNN, RF, and XGB provide an accuracy of 9S% and an Fl-score of 0. 9S. We also analyze the impact of reducing the number of features on accuracy and training time.","author":[{"family":"Ahmed","given":"Aqeel"},{"family":"Tjortjis","given":"Christos"}],"citation-key":"ahmedMachineLearningBased2022","container-title":"2022 International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Energy Technologies (ICECET)","DOI":"10.1109/ICECET55527.2022.9872817","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,7]]},"page":"1-6","title":"Machine Learning based IoT-BotNet Attack Detection Using Real-time Heterogeneous Data","type":"paper-conference"},
  {"id":"ahmedModelingArtificialIntelligencebased2023","abstract":"The recent COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected emerging economies' global supply chains (SCs) by disrupting their manufacturing activities. To ensure business survivability during the current and post-COVID-19 era, it is crucial to adopt artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to renovate traditional manufacturing activities. The fifth industrial revolution, Industry 5.0 (I5.0), and artificial intelligence (AI) offer the overwhelming po-tential to build an inclusive digital future by ensuring supply chain (SC) resiliency and sustainability. Accord-ingly, this research aims to identify, assess, and prioritize the AI-based imperatives of I5.0 to improve SC resiliency. An integrated and intelligent approach consisting of Pareto analysis, the Bayesian approach, and the Best-Worst Method (BWM) was developed to fulfill the objectives. Based on the literature review and expert opinions, nine AI-based imperatives were identified and analyzed using Bayesian-BWM to evaluate their po-tential applicability. The findings reveal that real-time tracking of SC activities using the Internet of Things (IoT) is the most crucial AI-based imperative to improving a manufacturing SC's survivability. The research insights can assist industry leaders, practitioners, and relevant stakeholders in dealing with the impacts of large-scale SC disruptions in the post-COVID-19 era.","author":[{"family":"Ahmed","given":"Tazim"},{"family":"Karmaker","given":"Chitra Lekha"},{"family":"Nasir","given":"Sumaiya Benta"},{"family":"Moktadir","given":"Md.

However the traditional supply chain faced lot of challenges these days because of the complex networks. Blockchain integrated with IoT framework has the potential to overcome the challenges faced by the conventional systems across industries. Basically the IoT integrated blockchain system provides enough benefits such as connecting the link between the flows in the supply chain to improve the efficiency of the supply chain network, makes the system transparent that can reduce the code of conduct violation throughout the supply chain networks, the immutable properties helps the stakeholders to trace the products throughout the networks. Even though blockchain based system provides enough benefits across industries, so far the implementation rate is very low because of the lack of knowledge about the benefits of blockchain system as well as lack of understanding about how and why it is needed in their fields. In this paper we will highlight the difference between the conventional supply chain as well as blockchain based supply chain and the benefits of implementing blockchain in different sectors such as automotive, pharmaceutical, food industry, retail. This article will highlights the problems currently facing by the above mentioned industries by using the conventional supply chain as well as the solutions to the problems provide the blockchain based systems in those industries.

  {"id":"akrasi-mensahOverviewTechnologiesImproving2022","abstract":"Since the inception of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, researchers have been fascinated with the idea of integrating blockchain technology into other fields, such as health and manufacturing. Despite the benefits of blockchain, which include immutability, transparency, and traceability, certain issues that limit its integration with IIoT still linger. One of these prominent problems is the storage inefficiency of the blockchain. Due to the append-only nature of the blockchain, the growth of the blockchain ledger inevitably leads to high storage requirements for blockchain peers. This poses a challenge for its integration with the IIoT, where high volumes of data are generated at a relatively faster rate than in applications such as financial systems. Therefore, there is a need for blockchain architectures that deal effectively with the rapid growth of the blockchain ledger. This paper discusses the problem of storage inefficiency in existing blockchain systems, how this affects their scalability, and the challenges that this poses to their integration with IIoT. This paper explores existing solutions for improving the storage efficiency of blockchain-IIoT systems, classifying these proposed solutions according to their approaches and providing insight into their effectiveness through a detailed comparative analysis and examination of their long-term sustainability. Potential directions for future research on the enhancement of storage efficiency in blockchain-IIoT systems are also discussed.","author":[{"family":"Akrasi-Mensah","given":"Nana Kwadwo"},{"family":"Tchao","given":"Eric Tutu"},{"family":"Sikora","given":"Axel"},{"family":"Agbemenu","given":"Andrew Selasi"},{"family":"Nunoo-Mensah","given":"Henry"},{"family":"Ahmed","given":"Abdul-Rahman"},{"family":"Welte","given":"Dominik"},{"family":"Keelson","given":"Eliel"}],"citation-key":"akrasi-mensahOverviewTechnologiesImproving2022","container-title":"ELECTRONICS","DOI":"10.3390/electronics11162513","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,8]]},"title":"An Overview of Technologies for Improving Storage Efficiency in Blockchain-Based IIoT Applications","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"alaghebandAdvancedDigitalSignatures2022","abstract":"Internet of Things (IoT) systems in different areas, such as manufacturing, transportation, and healthcare, are the convergence of several technologies. There are many concerns about security and privacy drawbacks in IoT systems. Apart from confidentiality supported by encryption primitives, authenticity and non-repudiation are of utmost importance. IoT entities generally use conventional digital signature schemes to achieve imperative goals. However, there are some state-of-the-art digital signatures with more functionalities, IoT-friendly properties, and privacy-preserving features. This survey paper aims to accelerate the adoption of advanced digital signatures. We bridge the gap between the advanced theoretical digital signatures recently designed in cryptographic-oriented papers and the applied IoT systems. It aids researchers in achieving more security, privacy as well as some unique functionality aspects. First, we illustrate the benefits of the hierarchical and heterogeneous IoT architecture supporting the end-edge-fog-cloud continuum accompanying blockchain technology. Second, our survey delves into five state-of-the-art digital signatures, including randomizable, keyless, double-authentication-prevention, sanitizable, and redactable schemes, that are aligned with entities in IoT systems. We provide an outline, taxonomy, comparison table, and diverse IoT-based use cases for each of them. Then, the integration of primitives and the relationship diagrams give guidelines to help select the appropriate advanced digital signatures and highlights how researchers can use them with different IoT entities for preserving privacy and management of trust.","author":[{"family":"Alagheband","given":"Mahdi R."},{"family":"Mashatan","given":"Atefeh"}],"citation-key":"alaghebandAdvancedDigitalSignatures2022","container-title":"INTERNET OF THINGS","DOI":"10.1016/j.iot.2021.100492","ISSN":"2543-1536","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,5]]},"title":"Advanced digital signatures for preserving privacy and trust management in hierarchical heterogeneous IoT: Taxonomy, capabilities, and objectives","type":"article-journal","volume":"18"},

  {"id":"alamBlockchainBasedSolutionsSupporting2022","abstract":"The Internet of Things (IoT) has radically transformed how patient information and healthcare monitoring are monitored and recorded and has revolutionized the area by ensuring regular 24 x 7 tracking without costly and restricted human resources and with a low mistake probability. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a subsection of the Internet of things (IoT) that uses medical equipment as things or nodes to enable cost-effective and efficient patient monitoring and recording. The IoMT can cope with a wide range of problems, including observing patients in hospitals, monitoring patients in their homes, and assisting consulting physicians and nurses in monitoring health conditions at regular intervals and issuing warning signals if emergency care is necessary. EEG signals, electrocardiograms (ECGs), blood sugar levels, blood pressure levels, and other conditions can be examined. In crucial situations, quick and real-time analysis is essential, and failure to provide careful attention can be fatal. A cloud-based IoT platform cannot handle these latency-sensitive conditions. Fog computing (FC) is a novel paradigm for assigning, processing, and storing resources to IoT devices with limited resources. Where substantial processing power or storage is required, all nodes in a fog computing scheme can delegate their jobs to local fog nodes rather than forwarding them to the cloud module at a greater distance. Identifying potential security risks and putting in place adequate security measures are critical. This work aims to examine a blockchain (BC) as a potential tool for mitigating the impact of these difficulties in conjunction with fog computing. This research shows that blockchain can overcome fog computing's privacy and security concerns. It also discusses blockchain's issues and limitations from the perspective of fog computing (FC) and the IoMT.","author":[{"family":"Alam","given":"Shadab"},{"family":"Shuaib","given":"Mohammed"},{"family":"Ahmad","given":"Sadaf"},{"family":"Jayakody","given":"Dushantha Nalin K."},{"family":"Muthanna","given":"Ammar"},{"family":"Bharany","given":"Salil"},{"family":"Elgendy","given":"Ibrahim A."}],"citation-key":"alamBlockchainBasedSolutionsSupporting2022","container-title":"SUSTAINABILITY","DOI":"10.3390/su142215312","issue":"22","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,11]]},"title":"Blockchain-Based Solutions Supporting Reliable Healthcare for Fog Computing and Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) Integration","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"alanaziAnomalyDetectionInternet2022","abstract":"The Internet of Things (IoT) has been deployed in diverse critical sectors with the aim of improving quality of service and facilitating human lives. The IoT revolution has redefined digital services in different domains by improving efficiency, productivity, and cost-effectiveness. Many service providers have adapted IoT systems or plan to integrate them as integral parts of their systems' operation; however, IoT security issues remain a significant challenge. To minimize the risk of cyberattacks on IoT networks, anomaly detection based on machine learning can be an effective security solution to overcome a wide range of IoT cyberattacks. Although various detection techniques have been proposed in the literature, existing detection methods address limited cyberattacks and utilize outdated datasets for evaluations. In this paper, we propose an intelligent, effective, and lightweight detection approach to detect several IoT attacks. Our proposed model includes a collab-orative feature selection method that selects the best distinctive features and eliminates unnecessary features to build an effective and efficient detection model. In the detection phase, we also proposed an ensemble of learning techniques to improve classification for predicting several different types of IoT attacks. The experimental results show that our proposed method can effectively and efficiently predict several IoT attacks with a higher accuracy rate of 99.984%, a precision rate of 99.982%, a recall rate of 99.984%, and an F1-score of 99.983%.","author":[{"family":"Alanazi","given":"Manal"},{"family":"Aljuhani","given":"Ahamed"}],"citation-key":"alanaziAnomalyDetectionInternet2022","container-title":"CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA","DOI":"10.32604/cmc.2022.024496","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"page":"261-279","title":"Anomaly Detection for Internet of Things Cyberattacks","type":"article-journal","volume":"72"},

  {"id":"alazabDiscreteTimevaryingGreywolf2022","abstract":"Internet of things (IoT) is an emerging network that is trending due to advances in computing and networking development. A botnet is an attack that threatens the IoT system because of the increased number of compromised connected IoT devices. The conventional counter measurements are unable to detect this attack. This problem becomes a hot topic for researchers and practitioners who introduced many secured solutions to stop the risks of a botnet attack. The intrusion detection systems are promising solutions to tackle botnet attacks and discover malicious patterns. Recently, many studies investigated the impact of reducing the number of dataset’s attributes (features) on the performance of detecting IoT attacks. Selecting the relevant features in a dataset is a data mining technique that has been efficiently integrated with designing secured systems for detecting botnets. This research paper proposes a new system for discovering botnet attacks in the context of IoT by applying a wrapper feature selection (FS) technique using an improved algorithm inspired by the natural swarming architecture of gray wolves called Gray Wolves Optimization (GWO). The transfer function (TF) maps the standard GWO which is originally developed to work in continuous search space to perform its optimization job in discrete search space. Different types of TFs that belong to S type and V type groups are used to generate eight discrete versions of GWO to optimize the binary feature space. This study contributes by adopting time-variant TFs to identify the best time to switch the global search into local search to achieve trade-offs in the search job of the BGWO and approach to the best-optimized solution. Time-variant TFs facilitate the global search at the beginning of the search process to fetch new solutions in new regions of feature space. In the later phases of the search process, the need is to expose more searches in the local region to get the most optimized solution among the neighborhood solutions. A real IoT traffic that is represented by the N-BaIoT dataset is utilized to evaluate the BGWO and other compared methods. The comparison results of the experiments show that the time-variant TFs enhance the capability of the GWO optimizer in alleviating the premature conversion and finding the best feature subset within a reasonable running time. Therefore, the BGWO-TV-S1 is recommended to be integrated into the IoT network as an intrusion detection algorithm with accuracy 98.97%, fitness value 1.31%, 51.2210 selected features and running time 503.7132 s.","author":[{"family":"Alazab","given":"Moutaz"}],"citation-key":"alazabDiscreteTimevaryingGreywolf2022","container-title":"Computer Communications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comcom.2022.06.016","ISSN":"0140-3664","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"page":"405-416","title":"A discrete time-varying greywolf IoT botnet detection system","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140366422002183","volume":"192"},

Although many studies have focused on quality management in Industry 4.0, new technologies face difficulties in resolving problems arising from lack of trust, transparency, integrity, track-and-traceability, connectivity, and responsibility in evaluating quality. In this article, we discuss the potential of blockchain to deliver business value with transparent quality by introducing a new quality concept called “open quality”. A systematic literature review presents the increased visibility of open quality across the manufacturing system, based on which a “blockchain-enabled open quality” (OQB) framework in the fourth industrial revolution is proposed. The research contributes by providing a platform to share manufacturing information regarding quality within the entire system, thus ensuring that all members and processes of the system obtain verified information to enhance trust, transparency, and track-and-traceability. By this, manufacturers are able to meet the expectations of the customer and stakeholder with an improved product and system quality. In addition, the potential threats associated with OQB system implementation and their possible solutions are also discussed. Moreover, research gaps that can be explored in future study and the opportunities for new concepts of quality in Industry 4.0 are presented.","author":[{"family":"Ali","given":"Shujaat"},{"family":"Shin","given":"Wan Seon"},{"family":"Song","given":"Hojun"}],"citation-key":"aliBlockchainEnabledOpenQuality2022","container-title":"SUSTAINABILITY","DOI":"10.3390/su141811677","issue":"18","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,9]]},"title":"Blockchain-Enabled Open Quality System for Smart Manufacturing: Applications and Challenges","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},

Many government entities such as United Kingdom, Estonia, Honduras, Denmark, Australia, Singapore and others have taken steps to unleash the potential of Blockchain technology. Dubai Government is aiming to become paperless by adopting the Blockchain technology for all transactions by 2021. The Blockchain is a disruptive technology that is playing a vital role in many sectors. It's a revolutionary technology transforming the way we think about trust as it enables transacting data in a decentralized structure without the need to have trusted central authorities. Blockchain technology promises to overcome security challenges in IoT enabled services such as enabling secure data sharing and data integrity. However, it also introduces new security challenges that should be investigated and tackled. In this paper, we review the literature to identify the potential use cases and application of Blockchain to enable government services. We also synthesized literature related to the security of Blockchain implementations to identify the security benefits, challenges and the proposed solutions. The analysis shows that is huge potential for Blockchain technology to be used in to enable smart government services. This paper also highlights future research in the areas of concerns that required further investigation.","author":[{"family":"Alketbi","given":"Ahmed"},{"family":"Nasir","given":"Qassim"},{"family":"Abu Talib","given":"Manar"}],"citation-key":"alketbiBlockchainGovernmentServices2018","container-title":"2018 15TH LEARNING AND TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE (L&T)","ISBN":"978-1-5386-4817-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"page":"112-119","publisher":"Effat Univ","title":"Blockchain for Government Services - Use Cases, Security Benefits and Challenges","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"alqahtaniIoTBotnetAttack2020","abstract":"Nowadays, Internet of Things (IoT) technology has various network applications and has attracted the interest of many research and industrial communities. Particularly, the number of vulnerable or unprotected IoT devices has drastically increased, along with the amount of suspicious activity, such as IoT botnet and large-scale cyber-attacks. In order to address this security issue, researchers have deployed machine and deep learning methods to detect attacks targeting compromised IoT devices. Despite these efforts, developing an efficient and effective attack detection approach for resource-constrained IoT devices remains a challenging task for the security research community. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective IoT botnet attack detection approach. The proposed approach relies on a Fisher-score-based feature selection method along with a genetic-based extreme gradient boosting (GXGBoost) model in order to determine the most relevant features and to detect IoT botnet attacks. The Fisher score is a representative filter-based feature selection method used to determine significant features and discard irrelevant features through the minimization of intra-class distance and the maximization of inter-class distance. On the other hand, GXGBoost is an optimal and effective model, used to classify the IoT botnet attacks. Several experiments were conducted on a public botnet dataset of IoT devices. The evaluation results obtained using holdout and 10-fold cross-validation techniques showed that the proposed approach had a high detection rate using only three out of the 115 data traffic features and improved the overall performance of the IoT botnet attack detection process. © 2020 by the authors.

  {"id":"alshormanUnsupervisedIntelligentSystem2020","abstract":"Recently, the number of Internet of Things (IoT) botnet attacks has increased tremendously due to the expansion of online IoT devices which can be easily compromised. Botnets are a common threat that takes advantage of the lack of basic security tools in IoT devices and can perform a series of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Developing new methods to detect compromised IoT devices is urgent in order to mitigate the negative consequences of these IoT botnets since the existing IoT botnet detection methods still present some issues, such as, relying on labelled data, not being validated with newer botnets, and using very complex machine learning algorithms. Anomaly detection methods are promising for detecting IoT botnet attacks since the amount of available normal data is very large. One of the powerful algorithms that can be used for anomaly detection is One Class Support vector machine (OCSVM). The efficiency of the OCSVM algorithm depends on several factors that greatly affect the classification results such as the subset of features that are used for training OCSVM model, the kernel type, and its hyperparameters. In this paper, a new unsupervised evolutionary IoT botnet detection method is proposed. The main contribution of the proposed method is to detect IoT botnet attacks launched form compromised IoT devices by exploiting the efficiency of a recent swarm intelligence algorithm called Grey Wolf Optimization algorithm (GWO) to optimize the hyperparameters of the OCSVM and at the same time to find the features that best describe the IoT botnet problem. To prove the efficiency of the proposed method, its performance is evaluated using typical anomaly detection evaluation measures over a new version of a real benchmark dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms all other algorithms in terms of true positive rate, false positive rate, and G-mean for all IoT device types. Also, it achieves the lowest detection time, while significantly reducing the number of selected features.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Al Shorman","given":"Amaal"},{"family":"Faris","given":"Hossam"},{"family":"Aljarah","given":"Ibrahim"}],"citation-key":"alshormanUnsupervisedIntelligentSystem2020","container-title":"Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing","container-title-short":"J Ambient Intell Human Comput","DOI":"10.1007/s12652-019-01387-y","ISSN":"1868-5137, 1868-5145","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7]]},"language":"en","page":"2809-2825","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Unsupervised intelligent system based on one class support vector machine and Grey Wolf optimization for IoT botnet detection","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12652-019-01387-y","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"aminantoDeepAbstractionWeighted2018","abstract":"The recent advances in mobile technologies have resulted in Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled devices becoming more pervasive and integrated into our daily lives. The security challenges that need to be overcome mainly stem from the open nature of a wireless medium, such as a Wi-Fi network. An impersonation attack is an attack in which an adversary is disguised as a legitimate party in a system or communications protocol. The connected devices are pervasive, generating high-dimensional data on a large scale, which complicates simultaneous detections. Feature learning, however, can circumvent the potential problems that could be caused by the large-volume nature of network data. This paper thus proposes a novel deep-feature extraction and selection (D-FES), which combines stacked feature extraction and weighted feature selection. The stacked autoencoding is capable of providing representations that are more meaningful by reconstructing the relevant information from its raw inputs. We then combine this with modified weighted feature selection inspired by an existing shallow-structured machine learner. We finally demonstrate the ability of the condensed set of features to reduce the bias of a machine learner model as well as the computational complexity. Our experimental results on a well-referenced Wi-Fi network benchmark data set, namely, the Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion data set, prove the usefulness and the utility of the proposed D-FES by achieving a detection accuracy of 99.918% and a false alarm rate of 0.012%, which is the most accurate detection of impersonation attacks reported in the literature.","author":[{"family":"Aminanto","given":"Muhamad Erza"},{"family":"Choi","given":"Rakyong"},{"family":"Tanuwidjaja","given":"Harry Chandra"},{"family":"Yoo","given":"Paul D."},{"family":"Kim","given":"Kwangjo"}],"citation-key":"aminantoDeepAbstractionWeighted2018","container-title":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY","DOI":"10.1109/TIFS.2017.2762828","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,3]]},"page":"621-636","title":"Deep Abstraction and Weighted Feature Selection for Wi-Fi Impersonation Detection","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

By considering particular parameters which overshadow the resiliency in distributed environments, we found several gaps in the investigated review papers that did not comprehensively touch on significantly related topics as we did. So, based on the resilient and dependable management approaches, we put forward a beneficial evaluation in this regard. As a novel taxonomy of distributed environments, we presented a well-organized classification of distributed systems. At the terminal stage, we selected 37 papers in the research process. We classified our categories into seven divisions and separately investigated each one their main ideas, advantages, challenges, and strategies, checking whether they involved security issues or not, simulation environments, datasets, and their environments to draw a cohesive taxonomy of reliable methods in terms of qualitative in distributed computing environments. This well-performed comparison enables us to evaluate all papers comprehensively and analyze their advantages and drawbacks. The SLR review indicated that security, latency, and fault tolerance are the most frequent parameters utilized in studied papers that show they play pivotal roles in the resiliency management of distributed environments. Most of the articles reviewed were published in 2020 and 2021. Besides, we proposed several future works based on existing deficiencies that can be considered for further studies.","author":[{"family":"Amiri","given":"Zahra"},{"family":"Heidari","given":"Arash"},{"family":"Navimipour","given":"Nima Jafari"},{"family":"Unal","given":"Mehmet"}],"citation-key":"amiriResilientDependabilityManagement2023","container-title":"CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS","DOI":"10.1007/s10586-022-03738-5","ISSN":"1386-7857","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,4]]},"page":"1565-1600","title":"Resilient and dependability management in distributed environments: a systematic and comprehensive literature review","type":"article-journal","volume":"26"},

We define a three-tier based architecture for DLT applications to systematically classify the technology solutions described in over 100 papers and startup initiatives. Protocol and Network Tier contains solutions for digital assets registration, transactions, data structure, and privacy and business rules implementation and the creation of peer-to-peer networks, ledger replication, and consensus-based state validation. Scalability and Interoperability Tier solutions address the scalability and interoperability issues with a focus on blockchain technology, where they manifest most often, slowing down its large-scale adoption. The paper closes with a discussion on challenges and opportunities for developing decentralized applications by providing a multi-step guideline for decentralizing the design and implementation of traditional systems.","author":[{"family":"Antal","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Cioara","given":"Tudor"},{"family":"Anghel","given":"Ionut"},{"family":"Antal","given":"Marcel"},{"family":"Salomie","given":"Ioan"}],"citation-key":"antalDistributedLedgerTechnology2021","container-title":"FUTURE INTERNET","DOI":"10.3390/fi13030062","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3]]},"title":"Distributed Ledger Technology Review and Decentralized Applications Development Guidelines","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"anteSmartContractsBlockchain2021","abstract":"Smart contracts are decentrally anchored scripts on blockchains or similar infrastructures that allow the transparent execution of predefined processes. Using smart contracts, business logic can be automated and assets such as money become programmable, which opens up previously inaccessible application potential. To date, smart contracts control billions in value. This paper analyzes 468 articles on the topic of smart contracts and their 20,188 references, providing a summary and analysis of the current state of research on smart contracts and identifying intellectual structures and emerging trends. Using exploratory factor analysis for co-citation analysis, six different strands of research are identified that concern technical, social, economic and legal disciplines: I) technical foundations, development and open questions of blockchain networks, II) blockchain and smart contracts for the Internet of Things, III) smart contract standardization, verification and security, IV) blockchain and smart contracts for the disruption of existing processes and industries, V) potentials and challenges of smart contracts, and VI) smart contracts and the law. The interrelations between these groups and individual high-impact publications are visualized using social network analysis. A structured overview of the main strands of research concerning smart contracts, their development over time, the relevance of smart contract platforms in research, and conceptual connections between publications and discourses is obtained. Based on the results, starting points for future research are derived, which offer researchers and practitioners a substantial basis for their work on smart contracts.","author":[{"family":"Ante","given":"Lennart"}],"citation-key":"anteSmartContractsBlockchain2021","container-title":"℡EMATICS AND INFORMATICS","DOI":"10.1016/j.tele.2020.101519","ISSN":"0736-5853","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3]]},"title":"Smart contracts on the blockchain - A bibliometric analysis and review","type":"article-journal","volume":"57"},

  {"id":"antwiSurveyNetworkOptimization2022","abstract":"The increase of the Internet of Things (IoT) calls for secure solutions for industrial applications. The security of IoT can be potentially improved by blockchain. However, blockchain technology suffers scalability issues which hinders integration with IoT. Solutions to blockchain's scalability issues, such as minimizing the computational complexity of consensus algorithms or blockchain storage requirements, have received attention. However, to realize the full potential of blockchain in IoT, the inefficiencies of its inter-peer communication must also be addressed. For example, blockchain uses a flooding technique to share blocks, resulting in duplicates and inefficient bandwidth usage. Moreover, blockchain peers use a random neighbor selection (RNS) technique to decide on other peers with whom to exchange blockchain data. As a result, the peer-to-peer (P2P) topology formation limits the effective achievable throughput. This paper provides a survey on the state-of-the-art network structures and communication mechanisms used in blockchain and establishes the need for network-based optimization. Additionally, it discusses the blockchain architecture and its layers categorizes existing literature into the layers and provides a survey on the state-of-the-art optimization frameworks, analyzing their effectiveness and ability to scale. Finally, this paper presents recommendations for future work.","author":[{"family":"Antwi","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Gadze","given":"James Dzisi"},{"family":"Tchao","given":"Eric Tutu"},{"family":"Sikora","given":"Axel"},{"family":"Nunoo-Mensah","given":"Henry"},{"family":"Agbemenu","given":"Andrew Selasi"},{"family":"Obour Agyekum","given":"Kwame Opunie-Boachie"},{"family":"Agyemang","given":"Justice Owusu"},{"family":"Welte","given":"Dominik"},{"family":"Keelson","given":"Eliel"}],"citation-key":"antwiSurveyNetworkOptimization2022","container-title":"ALGORITHMS","DOI":"10.3390/a15060193","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,6]]},"title":"A Survey on Network Optimization Techniques for Blockchain Systems","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"asadiDetectingBotnetUsing2020","abstract":"Botnets have recently been identified as serious Internet threats that are continually developing and expanding. Identifying botnets in the domain of network security is regarded as a new challenge and topic for research. There are several methods for detecting botnets in networks, and prior research has encountered problems, including a high error and inaccuracy in detection. In this paper, the botnet detection method by using a hybrid of particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with a voting system (BD-PSO-V) was used to improve the challenges of previous studies. The PSO algorithm was employed to select outstanding and effective features in the detection of botnets. The voting system, including a deep neural network algorithm, support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree C4.5, were utilized to identify botnets and classify samples. The decision-making strategy of the voting system was based on maximum votes, and the most important innovation of this research was to combine the PSO feature selection algorithm with a voting system using deep learning to identify botnets. Two datasets, ISOT and Bot-IoT, were employed to further verify the BD-PSO-V system performance. BD-PSO-V simulation improved the accuracy by an average of ∼0.42% and 0.17% in the ISOT dataset and the Bot-IoT dataset, respectively, compared to the other methods investigated. In addition, the effect of six well-known adversarial attacks on both datasets was evaluated. Despite a slight drop in accuracy rate, BD-PSO-V results had a promising performance against a variety of attacks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Asadi","given":"Mehdi"},{"family":"Jabraeil Jamali","given":"Mohammad Ali"},{"family":"Parsa","given":"Saeed"},{"family":"Majidnezhad","given":"Vahid"}],"citation-key":"asadiDetectingBotnetUsing2020","container-title":"Future Generation Computer Systems","container-title-short":"Future Generation Computer Systems","DOI":"10.1016/j.future.2020.01.055","ISSN":"0167739X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,6]]},"language":"en","page":"95-111","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Detecting botnet by using particle swarm optimization algorithm based on voting system","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167739X19323350","volume":"107"},

  {"id":"astorgaRevisitingFeasibilityPublic2022","abstract":"Digital certificates are regarded as the most secure and scalable way of implementing authentication services in the Internet today. They are used by most popular security protocols, including Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS). The lifecycle management of digital certificates relies on centralized Certification Authority (CA)-based Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs). However, the implementation of PKIs and certificate lifecycle management procedures in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments presents some challenges, mainly due to the high resource consumption that they imply and the lack of trust in the centralized CAs. This paper identifies and describes the main challenges to implement certificate-based public key cryptography in IIoT environments and it surveys the alternative approaches proposed so far in the literature to address these challenges. Most proposals rely on the introduction of a Trusted Third Party to aid the IIoT devices in tasks that exceed their capacity. The proposed alternatives are complementary and their application depends on the specific challenge to solve, the application scenario, and the capacities of the involved IIoT devices. This paper revisits all these alternatives in light of industrial communication models, identifying their strengths and weaknesses, and providing an in-depth comparative analysis.","author":[{"family":"Astorga","given":"Jasone"},{"family":"Barcelo","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Urbieta","given":"Aitor"},{"family":"Jacob","given":"Eduardo"}],"citation-key":"astorgaRevisitingFeasibilityPublic2022","container-title":"SENSORS","DOI":"10.3390/s22072561","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,4]]},"title":"Revisiting the Feasibility of Public Key Cryptography in Light of IIoT Communications","type":"article-journal","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"atlamTechnicalAspectsBlockchain2019","abstract":"Blockchain technology is getting a growing attention from various organizations and researchers as it provides magical solutions to the problems associated with the classical centralized architecture. Blockchain, whether public or private, is a distributed ledger with the capability of maintaining the integrity of transactions by decentralizing the ledger among participating users. On the other hand, the Internet of Things (IoT) represents a revolution of the Internet which can connect nearly all environment devices over the Internet to share their data to create novel services and applications for improving our quality of life. Although the centralized IoT system provides countless benefits, it raises several challenges. Resolving these challenges can be done by integrating IoT with blockchain technology. To be prepared for the integration process, this chapter provides an overview of technical aspects of the blockchain and IoT. It started by reviewing blockchain technology and its main structure. Applications and challenges of the blockchain are also presented. This is followed by reviewing the IoT system by highlighting common architecture and essential characteristics.

SHS is an integration of home appliances together with sensors to get automatic operations of heating, lighting, air conditioning, home security, health care systems, etc. Moreover, SHS allows homeowner to monitor and perform appliances functions remotely at any instant time via the Internet. Due to the widespread availability and proliferation of the SHS, attackers can impersonate as a homeowner to steal important data (e.g., vital signs) for doing extortion and life threatening. Therefore, in this paper, we present an approach of private Blockchain implementation for SHS to cope of its privacy and security issues.

Such attacks pose a significant threat to organizational security and user privacy. Utilizing Machine Learning (ML) in Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) has proven advantageous in countering novel zero-day attacks. However, the performance of such systems relies on several factors, one of which is prediction time. Processing speed in anomaly-based NIDS depends on a few elements, including the number of features fed to the ML model. NetFlow, a networking industry-standard protocol, offers many features that can be used to predict malicious attacks accurately. This paper examines NetFlow features and assesses their suitability in classifying network traffic. Our paper presents a model that detects attacks with (98-100%) accuracy using as few as 13 features.

However, the minimizing of the required features for classification is highly needed for overcoming scalability and computation resource problems in IoT environments. Having results which can be readily interpretable by cyber security analysts and producing signatures for the contemporary intrusion detection or network monitoring systems are other significant factors in this area in which quick and widespread security adaption is highly required. In this study, we applied feature selection to minimize the number of features in detecting the IoT bots.

The sensor node activities of both sensing phenomena in their immediate environments and reporting their findings to a centralized base station (BS) have remained a core platform to sustain heterogeneous service-centric applications. However, the adversarial threat to the sensors of the IoT paradigm remains significant. Denial of service (DoS) attacks, comprising a large volume of network packets, targeting a given sensor node(s) of the network, may cripple routine operations and cause catastrophic losses to emergency services.

  {"id":"balasubramaniamBlockchainIntelligentTransport2021","abstract":"Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is gaining attention but at the same time, road accidents, congestion, delays, etc. have also increased. Relative information about such events is vital. Such information can be presented in legal processes as digital proof. Availability of the information is not a problem as multidimensional data have been recorded all the time by ITS. Recording all the information in ITS arises the problem of fetching relevant information and removing other facts and figure that are not required to describe certain situations such as an accident. To address this issue, we analyze road accident data and reduce various dimensions with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). We conduct comparative analysis with three datasets where error rate for PCA is 32% with Dataset1. Likewise, error rate for LDA and NMF are 36% and 35%, receptively. While keeping in mind that such reduced data is helpful in many legal processes, we introduce Blockchain in the framework. Blockchain can make data immutable thus can be considered as digital proof. Blockchain also requires a smart contract in this situation between insurance companies to collect data in case of any uncertain situation. Such analysis can offer a different point of views and trends in data. Information can be more explainable to define the situation and helps to develop a friendly environment for day-to-day customers. The proposed framework provides dimensionality reduction of data that eventually reduce the data dimension to store in Blockchain.","author":[{"family":"Balasubramaniam","given":"Anandkumar"},{"family":"Gul","given":"Malik Junaid Jami"},{"family":"Menon","given":"Varun G."},{"family":"Paul","given":"Anand"}],"citation-key":"balasubramaniamBlockchainIntelligentTransport2021","container-title":"IETE TECHNICAL REVIEW","DOI":"10.1080/02564602.2020.1766385","ISSN":"0256-4602","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,4]]},"page":"438-449","title":"Blockchain For Intelligent Transport System","type":"article-journal","volume":"38"},

  {"id":"ballatoreConceptionMultichainMeet2023","abstract":"Recent literature claims that blockchain technology (BCT) has the potential to enhance interorganizational data sharing. Yet, in practice, BCTs implementation faces challenges that partly explain companies' reluctance to adopt BCT in their existing interorganizational environment. This is particularly striking in some economic sectors, such as the automotive industry transformed by the current digital servitization (DS) of the connected vehicle ecosystem; where traditional automotive businesses are being urged to collaborate with new ecosystem actors (e.g., insurance companies). With the perspective to tackle these challenges and promote the use of BCT at the interorganizational level, this article designs a BCT-based architecture based on Polkadot. Based on a design science research approach, we ensure alignment between the technological, interorganizational, and organizational dimensions of DS. Results are drawn from a dialog with the connected vehicle ecosystem's actors as well as a literature review at the intersection of BCT design, DS, and data sharing. Overall, results contribute to the existing literature on BCT design, as they emphasize the potential of multichain BCT to structure interorganizational settings. Additionally, the study provides design principles for integrating BCT into data-sharing contexts like the one observed in the connected vehicle ecosystem. More specifically, this research emphasizes the suitability of multichain architecture in allowing a balance between the decentralization of public blockchains and the control of private blockchains.","author":[{"family":"Ballatore","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Gerrits","given":"Luc"},{"family":"Kromes","given":"Roland"},{"family":"Arena","given":"Lise"},{"family":"Verdier","given":"Francois"}],"citation-key":"ballatoreConceptionMultichainMeet2023","container-title":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT","DOI":"10.1109/TEM.2023.3317208","ISSN":"0018-9391","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,4]]},"title":"Toward the Conception of a Multichain to Meet Users' Future Needs: A Design Science Research Approach to Digital Servitization in the Automotive Industry","type":"article-journal"},

Over recent years, many studies have been done to cope with this problem. In this paper, a comparative and analytical review on the state-of-the-art blockchain consensus algorithms is presented to enlighten the strengths and constraints of each algorithm. Based on their inherent specifications, each algorithm has a different domain of applicability that yields to propose several performance criteria for the evaluation of these algorithms. To overview and provide a basis of comparison for further work in the field, a set of incommensurable and conflicting performance evaluation criteria is identified and weighted by the pairwise comparison method. These criteria are classified into four categories including algorithms' throughput, the profitability of mining, degree of decentralization and consensus algorithms vulnerabilities and security issues. Based on the proposed framework, the pros and cons of consensus algorithms are systematically analyzed and compared in order to provide a deep understanding of the existing research challenges and clarify the future study directions.

  {"id":"baranwalBlockchainBasedResource2023","abstract":"Cloud computing and distributed edge computing provide computing resources to meet the surging demands for computing caused by developments in technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Mobile communication (5G). Centralized resource allocation approaches in both computing paradigms suffer from single-point failure, tampering, modification in allocation results, and biased actions. Recently, blockchain has become popular in designing decentralized systems because of its features, including transparency, decentralization, and anti-tamper. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the research works applying blockchain in resource allocation in both computing paradigms, addressing the issues in centralized resource allocation approaches. Firstly, we identify several key research questions acting as motivation. To provide background knowledge, first, we discuss the centralized resource allocation in both computing paradigms and associated challenges. Then we discuss blockchain, its structure, working, characteristics and types, followed by its benefits to resource allocation. We identify several metrics to provide a comparative study of the works. We present a depth overview of blockchain-based resource allocation works in three domains: cloud computing, distributed edge computing and integrated edge and cloud computing. In each domain, works are summarized from three aspects: works using blockchain platforms, works providing blockchain frameworks and works advocating blockchain. We discuss consensus mechanisms in the works related to blockchain-based resource allocation, as the consensus mechanism is a fundamental part of the blockchain. Further, we provide key challenges requiring our attention. Finally, we conclude the survey.","author":[{"family":"Baranwal","given":"Gaurav"},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Dinesh"},{"family":"Vidyarthi","given":"Deo Prakash"}],"citation-key":"baranwalBlockchainBasedResource2023","container-title":"COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS","DOI":"10.1016/j.comcom.2023.07.023","ISSN":"0140-3664","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,9,1]]},"page":"469-498","title":"Blockchain based resource allocation in cloud and distributed edge computing: A survey","type":"article-journal","volume":"209"},

  {"id":"baskaranSurveyPrivacyConcerns2020","abstract":"Due to the offering of many benefits, blockchain is a useful environment to build many applications in multiple fields such as cryptocurrency, Internet of Things (IoT), mobile applications and healthcare industry. However, it has a problem in ensuring the privacy of user data due to its public nature. Data on a blockchain is public and can reveal someone's personal data or transactions. Many applications that venture in blockchain such as financial applications, Internet of Things (IoT) and healthcare applications can fall victim to revelation of personal data and linking attack. Many solutions such as automated access-control protocol that does not require a third party, a local miner operating in a local private blockchain that enforces users' access control policy, a cryptographic protocol that lets contractual parties interact by using zero-knowledge proof, and computation of data query in a distributed way by using secure multi-party computation have been proposed to tackle this privacy issue in using blockchain. Hence, this paper provides a review on the current solutions that addresses the privacy issues of blockchain in different platforms. However, these solutions have some limitations that cannot be overlooked and proper measures must be taken to make blockchain to be able to better protect the privacy of its users. This paper also discusses the limitations of the solutions and looks into the aspects that need to be addressed.","author":[{"family":"Baskaran","given":"Hasventhran"},{"family":"Yussof","given":"Salman"},{"family":"Rahim","given":"Fiza Abdul"}],"citation-key":"baskaranSurveyPrivacyConcerns2020","collection-title":"Communications in Computer and Information Science","container-title":"ADVANCES IN CYBER SECURITY (ACES 2019)","DOI":"10.1007/978-981-15-2693-0_1","editor":[{"family":"Anbar","given":"M"},{"family":"Abdullah","given":"N"},{"family":"Manickam","given":"S"}],"ISBN":"978-981-15-2693-0; 978-981-15-2692-3","ISSN":"1865-0929","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"page":"3-17","publisher":"Univ Sains Malaysia, Natl Adv IPv6 Ctr","title":"A Survey on Privacy Concerns in Blockchain Applications and Current Blockchain Solutions to Preserve Data Privacy","type":"paper-conference","volume":"1132"},

As a result, a conceptual framework for understanding the dynamics of the emerging technologies in a smart city context, and for predicting the potential benefits of those technologies, is proposed.","author":[{"family":"Ben Dhaou","given":"Soumaya"},{"family":"Lopes","given":"Nuno"}],"citation-key":"bendhaouAnalysingTransformationalEffects2018","container-title":"2018 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SMART AND SUSTAINABLE TECHNOLOGIES (SPLITECH)","editor":[{"family":"Perkovic","given":"T"},{"family":"Milanovic","given":"Z"},{"family":"Vukojevic","given":"K"},{"family":"Rodrigues","given":"JJPC"},{"family":"Nizetic","given":"S"},{"family":"Patrono","given":"L"},{"family":"Solic","given":"P"}],"ISBN":"978-953-290-083-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"page":"100-109","publisher":"IEEE; IEEE Commun Soc; Fac Elect Engn Mech Engn & Naval Architecture; Univ Split, Fac Elect Engn Mech Engn & Naval Architecture; IEEE Croatia Sect; IEEE Commun Soc, Croatia Chapter","title":"Analysing the transformational Effects of Emerging Technologies on Smart Cities: Blockchain and IoT","type":"paper-conference"},
  {"id":"beniicheWayDAODecentralizing2021","abstract":"There has been a growing interest in adapting blockchain technologies to the specific needs of the Internet of Things (IoT) in order to develop a variety of blockchain-based IoT (BIoT) applications such as smart cities and Industry 4.0, where smart contracts play an important role. After briefly reviewing recent progress on BIoT, we explore the symbiosis of blockchain with other key technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and robots, while putting our focus on the emerging Tactile Internet for advanced human-to-machine interaction. Our interest is in exploiting the concept of the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which executes smart contracts and requires the involvement from humans to perform certain tasks that autonomous AI based software agents and robots themselves cannot do. In our search for synergies between human-agent-robot teamwork (HART) and the complementary strengths of the DAO, AI, and robots, we decentralize the Tactile Internet by leveraging mobile end-user equipment via partially or fully decentralized multi-access edge computing, and crowdsourcing of human expertise to decrease the completion time of physical tasks in the event of unreliable feedback forecasting of teleoperated robots. Finally, we aim at enhancing the human capabilities of unskilled crowd members by using our proposed nudge contract.","author":[{"family":"Beniiche","given":"Abdeljalil"},{"family":"Ebrahimzadeh","given":"Amin"},{"family":"Maier","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"beniicheWayDAODecentralizing2021","container-title":"IEEE NETWORK","DOI":"10.1109/MNET.021.1900667","ISSN":"0890-8044","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,8]]},"page":"190-197","title":"The Way of the DAO: Toward Decentralizing the Tactile Internet","type":"article-journal","volume":"35"},
  {"id":"bernalbernabePrivacyPreservingSolutionsBlockchain2019","abstract":"Blockchains offer a decentralized, immutable and verifiable ledger that can record transactions of digital assets, provoking a radical change in several innovative scenarios, such as smart cities, eHealth or eGovernment. However, blockchains are subject to different scalability, security and potential privacy issues, such as transaction linkability, crypto-keys management (e.g. recovery), on-chain data privacy, or compliance with privacy regulations (e.g. GDPR). To deal with these challenges, novel privacy-preserving solutions for blockchain based on crypto-privacy techniques are emerging to empower users with mechanisms to become anonymous and take control of their personal data during their digital transactions of any kind in the ledger, following a Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) model. In this sense, this paper performs a systematic review of the current state of the art on privacy-preserving research solutions and mechanisms in blockchain, as well as the main associated privacy challenges in this promising and disrupting technology. The survey covers privacy techniques in public and permissionless blockchains, e.g. Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as privacy-preserving research proposals and solutions in permissioned and private blockchains. Diverse blockchain scenarios are analyzed, encompassing, eGovernment, eHealth, cryptocurrencies, Smart cities, and Cooperative ITS.","author":[{"family":"Bernal Bernabe","given":"Jorge"},{"family":"Luis Canovas","given":"Jose"},{"family":"Hernandez-Ramos","given":"Jose L."},{"family":"Torres Moreno","given":"Rafael"},{"family":"Skarmeta","given":"Antonio"}],"citation-key":"bernalbernabePrivacyPreservingSolutionsBlockchain2019","container-title":"IEEE ACCESS","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2950872","ISSN":"2169-3536","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"page":"164908-164940","title":"Privacy-Preserving Solutions for Blockchain: Review and Challenges","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"bhandariFeatureSelectionImproves2020","abstract":"With the growth of 5G wireless technologies and IoT, it become urgent to develop robust network security systems, such as intrusions detection systems (IDS) to keep the networks secure. These IDS systems need to detect unauthorized access and attacks in real-time. However, most of the modern IDS are built based on complex machine learning models that are time-consuming to train. In this work, we propose a methodology using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) in combination with tree-based classifiers. SHAP can be used to select consistent and small feature subsets to reduce the execution time and improve classification accuracy. We demonstrate the proposed approach with the Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion Dataset (AWID) dataset in a series of multi-class classification experiments. Among the four classes (\"normal\", \"injection\", \"flooding\"and \"impersonation\"), it is well-known that the class impersonation is hard to be classified accurately. Tests show that we can use about 10% of the initial feature set without reducing the overall prediction accuracy. With this reduced set of features, the training time could be reduced as much as a factor of four, while slightly improving the discriminating ability to identify impersonation instances. This study suggests that by reducing the number of features, the classification algorithms are able to focus on key trends that differentiates the \"attacks\"classes from the \"normal\"class. Using a reduces subset of features improves IDS's accuracy and performance. Also, SHAP dependence plots capture the relationship between individual features and the classification decision. © 2020 ACM.","author":[{"family":"Bhandari","given":"S."},{"family":"Kukreja","given":"A.

  {"id":"binqaimEnergyEfficiencyInternet2020","abstract":"Personal mobile devices such as smartwatches, smart jewelry, and smart clothes have launched a new trend in the Internet of Things (IoT) era, namely the Internet of Wearable Things (IoWT). These wearables are small IoT devices capable of sensing, storing, processing, and exchanging data to assist users by improving their everyday life tasks through various applications. However, the IoWT has also brought new challenges for the research community to address such as increasing demand for enhanced computational power, better communication capabilities, improved security and privacy features, reduced form factor, minimal weight, and better comfort. Most wearables are battery-powered devices that need to be recharged - therefore, the limited battery life remains the bottleneck leading to the need to enhance the energy efficiency of wearables, thus, becoming an active research area. This paper presents a survey of energy-efficient solutions proposed for diverse IoWT applications by following the systematic literature review method. The available techniques published from 2010 to 2020 are scrutinized, and the taxonomy of the available solutions is presented based on the targeted application area. Moreover, a comprehensive qualitative analysis compares the proposed studies in each application area in terms of their advantages, disadvantages, and main contributions. Furthermore, a list of the most significant performance parameters is provided. A more in-depth discussion of the main techniques to enhance wearables' energy efficiency is presented by highlighting the trade-offs involved.

This enormous amount of data requires fast processing, huge storage capacity, secure dissemination, and aggregation to make it resistant from the attackers. Secure data dissemination for IoT-based applications has been a prominent issue in consideration with the heterogeneity in generated data. Existing secure data dissemination schemes are inadequate to handle secure data distribution. Research communities across the globe are focused on the delivery of the data among the sensor nodes and overlook the difficulty of its secure streaming. Hence, there is a need to validate the performance of secure data distribution schemes for IoT networks using relevant parameters. Motivated from the aforementioned facts, in this study, we perform a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art techniques, which can verify and validate the performance of data dissemination schemes for IoT networks. We present a solution taxonomy of various verification and validation methods along with their merits and demerits.

  {"id":"bojarajuluIntelligentIoTBOTNETAttack2022","abstract":"The botnet have developed into a severe risk to Internet of Things (IoT) systems as a result of manufacturers ‘insufficient security policies and end users’ lack of security awareness. By default, several ports are open and user credentials are left unmodified. ML and DL strategies have been suggested in numerous latest research for identifying and categorising botnet assaults in the IoT context, but still, it has a few issues like high error susceptibility, working only with a large amount of data, poor quality, and data acquisition. This research provided use of a brand-new IoT botnet detector built on an improved hybrid classifier. The proposed work's main components are \"pre-processing, feature extraction, feature selection, and attack detection.\" Following that, the improved Information Gain (IIG) model is used to choose the most reliable characteristics from the received information. To detect an attack, a hybrid classifier is utilized which can be constructed by integrating the optimized Bi-GRU with the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). To increase the detection accuracy of IoT-BOTNETS, a novel hybrid optimization approach called SMIE (Slime Mould with Immunity Evolution) is created by conceptually integrating two conventional optimization modes: Coronavirus herd immunity optimizer (CHIO) and the Slime mould algorithm. The final output of the hybrid classifier displays the presence or absence of IoT-BOTNET attacks. The projected model's accuracy is 97%, which is 22.6%, 18.5%, 27.8%, 22.6%, and 24.8% higher than the previous models like GWO+ HC, SSO+ HC, WOA+ HC, SMA+ HC, and CHIO+ HC, respectively.","author":[{"family":"Bojarajulu","given":"Balaganesh"},{"family":"Tanwar","given":"Sarvesh"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Thipendra Pal"}],"citation-key":"bojarajuluIntelligentIoTBOTNETAttack2022","container-title":"Computers & Security","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2022.103064","ISSN":"0167-4048","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"page":"103064","title":"Intelligent IoT-BOTNET Attack Detection Model with optimized Hybrid Classification Model","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404822004564"},

  {"id":"bonabUrbanQuantumLeap2023","abstract":"Contemporary smart city solutions rely on standardized von Neumann architecture, in which single data units are coded as “0” or “1.” Conversely, urban quantum technologies rely on the fundamental principles of quantum physics, transcending the conventions of the current computational paradigm. On the one hand, urban quantum technologies hold managerial relevance for future smart cities. On the other hand, they are often overlooked by smart city researchers. Accordingly, their value as a breakthrough technological paradigm is still largely unexplored. In this article, we look at how quantum technologies may contribute to existing smart city solutions, including the Internet of Things, cloud computing, big data, ICT, smart transportation, artificial intelligence, and blockchain. First, through a semi-systematic review of eighty articles on quantum computing within the social science domain, we identify two relevant classes of urban quantum technologies: quantum communication and quantum computing. Second, we establish a comprehensive taxonomy of conventional smart city solutions based on the automated content analysis of 567 abstracts of articles on the technological aspects of smart cities. Third, we investigate potential associations between two classes of technologies (conventional smart city solutions and urban quantum technologies) by analyzing the semantic relationships between eighty articles on quantum technologies according to the frequency of keywords denoting different types of conventional smart city solutions. Finally, we triangulate our findings through a thematic analysis of potential uses of quantum technologies within identified categories of smart city solutions.","author":[{"family":"Bonab","given":"Aysan Bashirpour"},{"family":"Fedele","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Formisano","given":"Vincenzo"},{"family":"Rudko","given":"Ihor"}],"citation-key":"bonabUrbanQuantumLeap2023","container-title":"CITIES","DOI":"10.1016/j.cities.2023.104459","ISSN":"0264-2751","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,9]]},"title":"Urban quantum leap: A comprehensive review and analysis of quantum technologies for smart cities","type":"article-journal","volume":"140"},

  {"id":"bourechakConfluenceArtificialIntelligence2023","abstract":"Given its advantages in low latency, fast response, context-aware services, mobility, and privacy preservation, edge computing has emerged as the key support for intelligent applications and 5G/6G Internet of things (IoT) networks. This technology extends the cloud by providing intermediate services at the edge of the network and improving the quality of service for latency-sensitive applications. Many AI-based solutions with machine learning, deep learning, and swarm intelligence have exhibited the high potential to perform intelligent cognitive sensing, intelligent network management, big data analytics, and security enhancement for edge-based smart applications. Despite its many benefits, there are still concerns about the required capabilities of intelligent edge computing to deal with the computational complexity of machine learning techniques for big IoT data analytics. Resource constraints of edge computing, distributed computing, efficient orchestration, and synchronization of resources are all factors that require attention for quality of service improvement and cost-effective development of edge-based smart applications. In this context, this paper aims to explore the confluence of AI and edge in many application domains in order to leverage the potential of the existing research around these factors and identify new perspectives. The confluence of edge computing and AI improves the quality of user experience in emergency situations, such as in the Internet of vehicles, where critical inaccuracies or delays can lead to damage and accidents. These are the same factors that most studies have used to evaluate the success of an edge-based application. In this review, we first provide an in-depth analysis of the state of the art of AI in edge-based applications with a focus on eight application areas: smart agriculture, smart environment, smart grid, smart healthcare, smart industry, smart education, smart transportation, and security and privacy. Then, we present a qualitative comparison that emphasizes the main objective of the confluence, the roles and the use of artificial intelligence at the network edge, and the key enabling technologies for edge analytics. Then, open challenges, future research directions, and perspectives are identified and discussed. Finally, some conclusions are drawn.","author":[{"family":"Bourechak","given":"Amira"},{"family":"Zedadra","given":"Ouarda"},{"family":"Kouahla","given":"Mohamed Nadjib"},{"family":"Guerrieri","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Seridi","given":"Hamid"},{"family":"Fortino","given":"Giancarlo"}],"citation-key":"bourechakConfluenceArtificialIntelligence2023","container-title":"SENSORS","DOI":"10.3390/s23031639","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,2]]},"title":"At the Confluence of Artificial Intelligence and Edge Computing in IoT-Based Applications: A Review and New Perspectives","type":"article-journal","volume":"23"},

While the research community has provided significant effort in either BC or I4.0 research domains, the complex implications of the adoption of BC technologies in this specific context are not analyzed in depth. This is a serious drawback because of the multiple and heterogeneous interactions between participants in the production network. In fact, researchers and practitioners involved in planning and deployment of I4.0 solutions may still face questions related to the needs solved by BC, the I4.0-related adoption scenarios explored, and the Key Performance Indicators to assess the effectiveness of these technologies. In this paper, we survey the existing literature to identify shared definitions and drivers that lead to the adoption of BC technologies in I4.0. Then, we analyze several practical use cases-under the umbrella (smart) contexts of Factory, Healthcare, and Energy-highlighting the need for comprehensive analysis including not only functional and architectural characteristics but also performance. We collect a number of Key Performance Indicators and organize the dozen aliases and variants, explaining their relationships and pointing at the relevant studies. Finally, we discuss limitations, challenges and future directions related to BC application to I4.0, and the role of performance analysis in this research.","author":[{"family":"Bovenzi","given":"Giampaolo"},{"family":"Aceto","given":"Giuseppe"},{"family":"Persico","given":"Valerio"},{"family":"Pescape","given":"Antonio"}],"citation-key":"bovenziBlockchainPerformanceIndustry2023","container-title":"JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL INFORMATION INTEGRATION","DOI":"10.1016/j.jii.2023.100513","ISSN":"2467-964X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,12]]},"title":"Blockchain Performance in Industry 4.0: Drivers, use cases, and future directions","type":"article-journal","volume":"36"},
  {"id":"bozorgastlNewTrendsDigital2021","abstract":"Nowadays, with the widespread industrial use of digital data and relative maturity of the Internet of Things (IoT), and data analytics (artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and data visualization), we can design, customize, and implement plenty of systems which once were unimaginable. A combination of the mentioned fields leads to the emergence of new technology, i.e., Digital Twins (DT). The potentials of DT in different fields have changed the perspective of most academia/industry leaders around the world. The fundamental concept of DT lies in developing the living and intelligent model which faithfully mimics the physical system during the lifetime of the physical ones. Indeed, by co-evolving with the physical system, the DT can precisely explore the design flaws of the virtual environment and make quick changes, which will ameliorate the design, prevent tedious confirmation and experiments. In review research, the principle definitions, architecture, characteristics of DT as well as the enabling key technologies of this context are briefly provided; after that, the ranges of applications of DT in manufacturing and industry will be presented. In particular, the evaluation details and challenges related to the zero-emission ships along with its DT model, which recently have been getting attention in academia, industry, and government, have been discussed. Eventually, the standardized application of blockchain technology, regarded as distributed ledger technology (DLT), will be introduced as a practical solution for data storage, data access, data sharing, data security, and data integrity in the DT.","author":[{"family":"Bozorgastl","given":"Zavareh"},{"family":"Foroozan","given":"Hossein"},{"family":"Gheisarnejad","given":"Meysam"},{"family":"Khooban","given":"Mohammad-Hassan"}],"citation-key":"bozorgastlNewTrendsDigital2021","container-title":"NAVAL ENGINEERS JOURNAL","ISSN":"0028-1425","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,1]]},"page":"115-135","title":"New Trends on Digital Twin-Based Blockchain Technology in Zero-Emission Ship Applications","type":"article-journal","volume":"133"},

  {"id":"burlacuSmartCitiesTransportation2022","abstract":"The concept “smart city” nowadays designates a plethora of things. The multiple meanings associated with the smart city, and its imperfect synonym the “robotic city”, continue to provide a topic of debate. In this paper we aim to present an epistemologically grounded review of articles focused on the concept of “smart city” and its correlatives. The goal of this article is to ascertain whether the scientific character of the theories employed in such articles is discussed and/or ascertained. For this purpose, we used Popper's method of falsification: a theory's scientific character is determined by its falsifiability and eventual falsification. Papers from the literature were extracted using the PRISMA method, and 15 studies were assessed as eligible for analysis. Most conclusions and results expounded in the articles reviewed that claim to be scientific are arguably based on the unsound logic of verification and confirmation rather than falsification. This has the detrimental effect of reducing to the category of logically false universal instantiations the majority of conclusions about (a) smart city services and infrastructures, (b) intelligent transportation systems and (c) blockchain/Internet of Things.","author":[{"family":"Burlacu","given":"Mihai"},{"family":"Boboc","given":"Razvan Gabriel"},{"family":"Butila","given":"Eugen Valentin"}],"citation-key":"burlacuSmartCitiesTransportation2022","container-title":"SUSTAINABILITY","DOI":"10.3390/su14138109","issue":"13","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,7]]},"title":"Smart Cities and Transportation: Reviewing the Scientific Character of the Theories","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"butheleziSystematicReviewAdoption2022","abstract":"This paper systematically reviews the literature on the adoption of blockchain technology in supply chain management (SCM) processes. Using the PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis) methodology, 53 peer-reviewed research publications from five different databases (IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, Scopus, Google Scholar, and EBSCOhost) were selected and analyzed using a classification coding framework. The findings reveal that agri-food traceability, blockchain security, smart contracts, and the internet of things (IoT) were the significant identified current trends in the use of blockchain in SCM processes. The key identified challenges include high costs of transactions and a lack of trust between stakeholders. Identified solutions were blockchain traceability systems and the use of smart contracts and IoTs. In addition, this paper identified gaps in the literature that need to be addressed in future studies.","author":[{"family":"Buthelezi","given":"Bongisizwe Erasmus"},{"family":"Ndayizigamiye","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Twinomurinzi","given":"Hossana"},{"family":"Dube","given":"Shopee M."}],"citation-key":"butheleziSystematicReviewAdoption2022","container-title":"JOURNAL OF GLOBAL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT","DOI":"10.4018/JGIM.297625","ISSN":"1062-7375","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"title":"A Systematic Review of the Adoption of Blockchain for Supply Chain Processes","type":"article-journal","volume":"30"},

  {"id":"buttSurveyCOVID19Data2023","abstract":"Coronaviruses are a well-established and deadly group of viruses that cause illness in both humans and animals. The novel type of this virus group, named COVID-19, was firstly reported in December 2019, and, with the passage of time, coronavirus has spread to almost all parts of the world. Coronavirus has been the cause of millions of deaths around the world. Furthermore, many countries are struggling with COVID-19 and have experimented with various kinds of vaccines to eliminate the deadly virus and its variants. This survey deals with COVID-19 data analysis and its impact on human social life. Data analysis and information related to coronavirus can greatly help scientists and governments in controlling the spread and symptoms of the deadly coronavirus. In this survey, we cover many areas of discussion related to COVID-19 data analysis, such as how artificial intelligence, along with machine learning, deep learning, and IoT, have worked together to fight against COVID-19. We also discuss artificial intelligence and IoT techniques used to forecast, detect, and diagnose patients of the novel coronavirus. Moreover, this survey also describes how fake news, doctored results, and conspiracy theories were spread over social media sites, such as Twitter, by applying various social network analysis and sentimental analysis techniques. A comprehensive comparative analysis of existing techniques has also been conducted. In the end, the Discussion section presents different data analysis techniques, provides future directions for research, and suggests general guidelines for handling coronavirus, as well as changing work and life conditions.","author":[{"family":"Butt","given":"Muhammad Junaid"},{"family":"Malik","given":"Ahmad Kamran"},{"family":"Qamar","given":"Nafees"},{"family":"Yar","given":"Samad"},{"family":"Malik","given":"Arif Jamal"},{"family":"Rauf","given":"Usman"}],"citation-key":"buttSurveyCOVID19Data2023","container-title":"SENSORS","DOI":"10.3390/s23125543","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,6]]},"title":"A Survey on COVID-19 Data Analysis Using AI, IoT, and Social Media","type":"article-journal","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"calvillo-arbizuInternetThingsHealth2021","abstract":"Background and objectives: The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has been extensively applied to several sectors in the last years, ranging from industry to smart cities. In the health domain, IoT makes possible new scenarios of healthcare delivery as well as collecting and processing health data in real time from sensors in order to make informed decisions. However, this domain is complex and presents several technological challenges. Despite the extensive literature about this topic, the application of IoT in healthcare scarcely covers requirements of this sector. Methods: A literature review from January 2010 to February 2021 was performed resulting in 12,108 articles. After filtering by title, abstract, and content, 86 were eligible and examined according to three requirement themes: data lifecycle; trust, security, and privacy; and human-related issues. Results: The analysis of the reviewed literature shows that most approaches consider IoT application in healthcare merely as in any other domain (industry, smart cities...), with no regard of the specific requirements of this domain. Conclusions: Future effort s in this matter should be aligned with the specific requirements and needs of the health domain, so that exploiting the capabilities of the IoT paradigm may represent a meaningful step forward in the application of this technology in healthcare.

  {"id":"caoWhenInternetThings2019","abstract":"Blockchain has been regarded as a promising technology for IoT, since it provides significant solutions for decentralized networks that can address trust and security concerns, high maintenance cost problems, and so on. The decentralization provided by blockchain can be largely attributed to the use of a consensus mechanism, which enables peer-to-peer trading in a distributed manner without the involvement of any third party. This article starts by introducing the basic concept of blockchain and illustrating why a consensus mechanism plays an indispensable role in a blockchain enabled IoT system. Then we discuss the main ideas of two famous consensus mechanisms, PoW and PoS, and list their limitations in IoT. Next, two mainstream DAG based consensus mechanisms, the Tangle and Hashgraph, are reviewed to show why DAG consensus is more suitable for IoT system than PoW and PoS. Potential issues and challenges of DAG based consensus mechanisms to be addressed in the future are discussed in the last section.","author":[{"family":"Cao","given":"Bin"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yixin"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Long"},{"family":"Mumtaz","given":"Shahid"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Zhenyu"},{"family":"Peng","given":"Mugen"}],"citation-key":"caoWhenInternetThings2019","container-title":"IEEE NETWORK","DOI":"10.1109/MNET.2019.1900002","ISSN":"0890-8044","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12]]},"page":"133-139","title":"When Internet of Things Meets Blockchain: Challenges in Distributed Consensus","type":"article-journal","volume":"33"},

  {"id":"carterFastLightweightIoT2022","abstract":"Anomaly detection is a method for identifying malware and other anomalies such as memory leaks on computing hosts and, more recently, Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Due to its lightweight resource use and efficacy, anomaly detection is a promising method to detect malware on small, resource-constrained hosts. Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the features, and hence the dimensionality of the anomaly detector, is common during the feature engineering process of classic machine learning methods, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM). However, as Neural Networks (NN) became more popular, many presumed that using PCA prior to using the data to train and deploy the model was unnecessary. In this work, we show that there is a significant advantage to using PCA for both SVM and NN-based anomaly detection. Doing so improves the performance and efficacy of malware detection models, and reduces the amount of data that needs to be stored on the device for on-device anomaly detection, thus making it useful for resource-constrained IoT devices. We also show that while pruning low-variance features may be an intuitive way to simplify a model, it is less effective than PCA to improve model training and deployment performance as well as model efficacy to detect malware.","author":[{"family":"Carter","given":"John"},{"family":"Mancoridis","given":"Spiros"},{"family":"Galinkin","given":"Erick"}],"citation-key":"carterFastLightweightIoT2022","collection-title":"SAC '22","container-title":"Proceedings of the 37th ACM/SIGAPP Symposium on Applied Computing","DOI":"10.1145/3477314.3508377","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-8713-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"page":"133–138","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","title":"Fast, Lightweight IoT Anomaly Detection Using Feature Pruning and PCA","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://doi-org.ezproxy.utm.my/10.1145/3477314.3508377"},
  {"id":"carterTradeoffModelFogCloud2020","abstract":"A steadily growing number of Internet-based service requests from the IoT have led to an increase in complexity and clients, resulting in an increased number of cybersecurity concerns. Although there are main security concerns with IoT services over cloud computing services, cloud computing is mostly preferred to provide seamless and scalable Intern-based services. Moreover, cloud service providers are continuously extending their capacity to reach more industries and address their concerns. For example, Amazon has recently launched a pay-as-you-go cloud computing service that will take place on satellite operators to provide more IoT services to industries such as the agricultural and shipping industries. However, the secure transfer of information within a space information network is of great concern due to numerous attacks between nodes to occur. This can be followed by loss of data Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Several researchers have proposed multifaceted solutions to these concerns, including blockchain application, digital signature, symmetric/asymmetric encryption schemes, and centralized and/or decentralized key management for space information networks. In this paper, we focus on the integration of fog-cloud computing and space information network. We primarily investigate the feasibility of fog-cloud architecture in space information networks and the benefits of having fog computing in space information networks' security. This is accomplished mainly by reviewing existing works on fog-cloud computing and space information networks and evaluating both proposed solutions to potential issues regarding security.","author":[{"family":"Carter","given":"Jarred Michael"},{"family":"Narman","given":"Husnu S."},{"family":"Cosgun","given":"Ozlem"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jinwei"}],"citation-key":"carterTradeoffModelFogCloud2020","container-title":"2020 IEEE CLOUD SUMMIT","DOI":"10.1109/IEEECloudSummit48914.2020.00020","ISBN":"978-1-72818-266-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"page":"91-96","publisher":"IEEE; IEEE Comp Soc; IEEE Comp Soc Tech Comm Cloud Comp","title":"Trade-off Model of Fog-Cloud Computing for Space Information Networks","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"chalaemwongwanStateArtChallenges2018","abstract":"Nowadays, the blockchain is a favorite platform, for instance, for use with cryptocurrency, smart contracts, IoT, and so forth. Blockchains are distributed ledgers that enable parties who do not trust each other to maintain states. The parties agree on the existence, values, and histories of the states. The blockchain applies the consensus protocol to verify the block which is distributing the network node. Consensus has many practices such as, for example, Byzantine general problem, Proof of work, and Proof of stake. However, there have not been numerous papers that have undertaken analysis with regard to various aspects, and which have incorporated the adoption summary as appropriate to the application. In this paper, we have provided a technical verification review with regard to the consensus algorithm taken from previous research. The audience will receive a consensus protocol, and the algorithm typically analyzes the application to match which platform is appropriate by viewing the node identity, energy saving and the tolerated power of the adversary, the data model, language, execution, application, and examples. Finally, we finish by presenting several research directions with regard to the consensus protocol.","author":[{"family":"Chalaemwongwan","given":"Nutthakorn"},{"family":"Kurutach","given":"Werasak"}],"citation-key":"chalaemwongwanStateArtChallenges2018","container-title":"2018 32ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION NETWORKING (ICOIN)","ISBN":"978-1-5386-2290-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"page":"957-962","publisher":"Korean Inst Informat Scientists & Engineers Informat Networking Soc; IEEE Comp Soc; IEEE","title":"State of the Art and Challenges Facing Consensus Protocols on Blockchain","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"chamolaComprehensiveReviewUnmanned2021","abstract":"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have revolutionized the aircraft industry in this decade. UAVs are now capable of carrying out remote sensing, remote monitoring, courier delivery, and a lot more. A lot of research is happening on making UAVs more robust using energy harvesting techniques to have a better battery lifetime, network performance and to secure against attackers. UAV networks are many times used for unmanned missions. There have been many attacks on civilian, military, and industrial targets that were carried out using remotely controlled or automated UAVs. This continued misuse has led to research in preventing unauthorized UAVs from causing damage to life and property. In this paper, we present a literature review of UAVs, UAV attacks, and their prevention using anti-UAV techniques. We first discuss the different types of UAVs, the regulatory laws for UAV activities, their use cases, recreational, and military UAV incidents. After understanding their operation, various techniques for monitoring and preventing UAV attacks are described along with case studies.","author":[{"family":"Chamola","given":"Vinay"},{"family":"Kotesh","given":"Pavan"},{"family":"Agarwal","given":"Aayush"},{"literal":"Naren"},{"family":"Gupta","given":"Navneet"},{"family":"Guizani","given":"Mohsen"}],"citation-key":"chamolaComprehensiveReviewUnmanned2021","container-title":"AD HOC NETWORKS","DOI":"10.1016/j.adhoc.2020.102324","ISSN":"1570-8705","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,1]]},"title":"A Comprehensive Review of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Attacks and Neutralization Techniques","type":"article-journal","volume":"111"},

A digital twin is a virtual representation of a real-world object or system. It is used to evaluate performance, and inefficiencies and design solutions to improve the efficiency of its physical counterpart. The Digital Twin is described as the integration of data between a physical and virtual asset. It is nothing but a replica of the physical object, known as a logical object, which reflects all the major characteristics and properties of the original product. To model a digital twin for a physical object or process, it uses artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and other supporting technologies like cloud and analytics. The review of digital twins in the manufacturing, health, and industrial sectors is mainly represented in this paper. It also discusses the significance, characteristics, and fundamentals of creating a digital twin for any physical asset or process.","author":[{"family":"Chandaluri","given":"Raghuveer"},{"family":"Nelakuditi","given":"Usha Rani"}],"citation-key":"chandaluriMonographComponentsDesign2022","container-title":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEXT-GENERATION COMPUTING","ISSN":"2229-4678","issue":"3, SI","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,10]]},"page":"530-541","title":"A Monograph on Components, Design and Applications of Digital Twin","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"chaudharyTaxonomySmartHealthcare2022","abstract":"There is a massive transformation in the traditional healthcare system from the specialist-centric approach to the patient-centric approach by adopting modern and intelligent healthcare solutions to build a smart healthcare system. It permits patients to directly share their medical data with the specialist for remote diagnosis without any human intervention. Furthermore, the remote monitoring of patients utilizing wearable sensors, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, and artificial intelligence (AI) has made the treatment readily accessible and affordable. However, the advancement also brings several security and privacy concerns that poorly maneuvered the effective performance of the smart healthcare system. An attacker can exploit the IoT infrastructure, perform an adversarial attack on AI models, and proliferate resource starvation attacks in smart healthcare system. To overcome the aforementioned issues, in this survey, we extensively reviewed and created a comprehensive taxonomy of various smart healthcare technologies such as wearable devices, digital healthcare, and body area networks (BANs), along with their security aspects and solutions for the smart healthcare system. Moreover, we propose an AI-based architecture with the 6G network interface to secure the data exchange between patients and medical practitioners. We have examined our proposed architecture with the case study based on the COVID-19 pandemic by adopting unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for data exchange. The performance of the proposed architecture is evaluated using various machine learning (ML) classification algorithms such as random forest (RF), naive Bayes (NB), logistic regression (LR), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and perceptron. The RF classification algorithm outperforms the conventional algorithms in terms of accuracy, i.e., 98%. Finally, we present open issues and research challenges associated with smart healthcare technologies.","author":[{"family":"Chaudhary","given":"Sachi"},{"family":"Kakkar","given":"Riya"},{"family":"Jadav","given":"Nilesh Kumar"},{"family":"Nair","given":"Anuja"},{"family":"Gupta","given":"Rajesh"},{"family":"Tanwar","given":"Sudeep"},{"family":"Agrawal","given":"Smita"},{"family":"Alshehri","given":"Mohammad Dahman"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Ravi"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Gulshan"},{"family":"Davidson","given":"Innocent E."}],"citation-key":"chaudharyTaxonomySmartHealthcare2022","container-title":"JOURNAL OF SENSORS","DOI":"10.1155/2022/1863838","ISSN":"1687-725X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,5]]},"title":"A Taxonomy on Smart Healthcare Technologies: Security Framework, Case Study, and Future Directions","type":"article-journal","volume":"2022"},

Using data on patent filings from 2003 to 2017, we apply machine learning to identify and classify innovations by their underlying technologies. We find that most FinTech innovations yield substantial value to innovators, with blockchain being particularly valuable. For the overall financial sector, internet of things (IoT), robo-advising, and blockchain are the most valuable innovation types. Innovations affect financial industries more negatively when they involve disruptive technologies from nonfinancial startups, but market leaders that invest heavily in their own innovation can avoid much of the negative value effect.

  {"id":"chenSurveyZeroKnowledgeAuthentication2023","abstract":"The Internet of Things (IoT) is ubiquitous in our lives. However, the inherent vulnerability of IoT smart devices can lead to the destruction of networks in untrustworthy environments. Therefore, authentication is a necessary tool to ensure the legitimacy of nodes and protect data security. Naturally, the authentication factors always include various sensitive users' information, such as passwords, ID cards, even biological information, etc. How to prevent privacy leakage has always been a problem faced by the IoT. Zero-knowledge authentication is a crucial cryptographic technology that uses authenticates nodes on the networks without revealing identity or any other data entered by users. However, zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) requires more complex data exchange protocols and more data transmission compared to traditional cryptography technologies. To understand how zero-knowledge authentication works in IoT, we produce a survey on zero-knowledge authentication in privacy-preserving IoT in the paper. First, we overview the IoT architecture and privacy, including security challenges and open question in different IoT layers. Next, we overview zero-knowledge authentication and provide a comprehensive analysis of designing zero-knowledge authentication protocols in various IoT networks. We summarize the advantages of ZKP-based authentication in IoT. Finally, it summarizes the potential problems and future directions of ZKP in IoT.","author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Zhigang"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Yuting"},{"family":"Song","given":"Xinxia"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Liqun"}],"citation-key":"chenSurveyZeroKnowledgeAuthentication2023","container-title":"ELECTRONICS","DOI":"10.3390/electronics12051145","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,3]]},"title":"A Survey on Zero-Knowledge Authentication for Internet of Things","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},

However, the research on storage and computation power for IoT is still in its early stages. The game theory converts the interaction between two IoT devices into a game where the conflict is resolved by utilizing the game's equilibrium conditions. Our goal with the game theory is to maximize the utility for every device in the IoT network. In this article, we review the recent game-theory-based solutions proposed in IoT networks. We summarize game theory concepts and categorize the common game models for ease of understanding for the reader. Later, we focus on analyzing solutions proposed in resource allocation, task scheduling, node selection, quality of service, and network security.

The proposed approach is validated on two benchmark datasets, namely, NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15, in addition to a third dataset, called IoT-Zeek dataset, which consists of Zeek network-based intrusion detection connection logs. We build the IoT-Zeek dataset by employing ensemble classification and deep learning models using publicly available malicious and benign threat intelligence on the Zeek connection logs of IoT devices. Moreover, we deploy and validate a deep learning-based anomaly detection model using autoencoders on each of the aforementioned datasets by utilizing the selected features obtained from the proposed optimization approach. The obtained results demonstrate that our approach outperform the existing state-of-the-art machine learning models in terms of f(1) score results, with 92.092% f(1) score on NSL-KDD dataset, 92.904 f(1) score on UNSW-NB15 dataset, and 97.302 f(1) score on IoT-Zeek dataset.

  {"id":"chowdhurySurveyBlockchainbasedPlatforms2020","abstract":"The Internet of Things (IoT) has recently emerged as an innovative technology capable of empowering various areas such as healthcare, agriculture, smart cities, smart homes and supply chain with real-time and state-of-the-art sensing capabilities. Due to the underlying potential of this technology, it already saw exponential growth in a wide variety of use-cases in multiple application domains. As researchers around the globe continue to investigate its aptitudes, a collective agreement is that to get the best out of this technology and to harness its full potential, IoT needs to sit upon a flexible network architecture with strong support for security, privacy and trust. On the other hand, blockchain (BC) technology has recently come into prominence as a breakthrough technology with the potential to deliver some valuable properties such as resiliency, support for integrity, anonymity, decentralization and autonomous control. Several BC platforms are proposed that may be suitable for different use-cases, including IoT applications. In such, the possibility to integrate the IoT and BC technology is seen as a potential solution to address some crucial issues. However, to achieve this, there must be a clear understanding of the requirements of different IoT applications and the suitability of a BC platform for a particular application satisfying its underlying requirements. This paper aims to achieve this goal by describing an evaluation framework which can be utilized to select a suitable BC platform for a given IoT application.","author":[{"family":"Chowdhury","given":"Mohammad Jabed Morshed"},{"family":"Ferdous","given":"Md Sadek"},{"family":"Biswas","given":"Kamanashis"},{"family":"Chowdhury","given":"Niaz"},{"family":"Muthukkumarasamy","given":"Vallipuram"}],"citation-key":"chowdhurySurveyBlockchainbasedPlatforms2020","container-title":"KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING REVIEW","DOI":"10.1017/S0269888920000284","ISSN":"0269-8889","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"title":"A survey on blockchain-based platforms for IoT use-cases","type":"article-journal","volume":"35"},

  {"id":"christidisBlockchainsSmartContracts2016","abstract":"Motivated by the recent explosion of interest around blockchains, we examine whether they make a good fit for the Internet of Things (IoT) sector. Blockchains allow us to have a distributed peer-to-peer network where non-trusting members can interact with each other without a trusted intermediary, in a verifiable manner. We review how this mechanism works and also look into smart contracts-scripts that reside on the blockchain that allow for the automation of multi-step processes. We then move into the IoT domain, and describe how a blockchain-IoT combination: 1) facilitates the sharing of services and resources leading to the creation of a marketplace of services between devices and 2) allows us to automate in a cryptographically verifiable manner several existing, time-consuming workflows. We also point out certain issues that should be considered before the deployment of a blockchain network in an IoT setting: from transactional privacy to the expected value of the digitized assets traded on the network. Wherever applicable, we identify solutions and workarounds. Our conclusion is that the blockchain-IoT combination is powerful and can cause significant transformations across several industries, paving the way for new business models and novel, distributed applications.","author":[{"family":"Christidis","given":"Konstantinos"},{"family":"Devetsikiotis","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"christidisBlockchainsSmartContracts2016","container-title":"IEEE ACCESS","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2566339","ISSN":"2169-3536","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"page":"2292-2303","title":"Blockchains and Smart Contracts for the Internet of Things","type":"article-journal","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"daniel-georgeImplementingDemandResponse2020","abstract":"Households and buildings became smarter due to IoT devices and as a result home and building automation solutions are operational almost everywhere. The proliferation of renewable distributed energy resources (DER), despite having a positive impact on the carbon footprint, created important operational problems for power systems. The intermittent nature of DER does not only make them unsuitable for controlling the grid but contributes to its instability. In order to accommodate more renewables into the grid there is a real need to increase its flexibility and therefore maintain its stability. Historically, balancing services and technological ancillary systems have been provided mainly by thermal and gas fired power plants, having an obvious negative impact on the carbon footprint. A possible alternative to ensure balancing and regulation might be the extensive use of demand response (DR) measures. The access to aggregated energy data acquired from a large number of households or office buildings enables the implementation of DR based on the intrinsic capabilities of the connected smart home devices, like power monitoring smart switches or plugs. After reviewing the existing situation in Europe related to DR measures and some information concerning the use of technologies like blockchain in the energy sector, this paper will present the concept of a smart home electric energy data aggregation platform (SHEEDAP), to be applied as a new type of power grid flexibility provider. As a novelty, the platform will use sub-metering devices from the smart home environment in order to perform DR actions.","author":[{"family":"Daniel-George","given":"Dumitrascu"},{"family":"Mihaela","given":"Coroiu"},{"family":"Bogdan","given":"Marina"},{"family":"Radu","given":"Tarau"}],"citation-key":"daniel-georgeImplementingDemandResponse2020","collection-title":"IEEE International Conference on Automation Quality and Testing Robotics","container-title":"PROCEEDINGS OF 2020 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AUTOMATION, QUALITY AND TESTING, ROBOTICS (AQTR)","DOI":"10.1109/aqtr49680.2020.9129991","editor":[{"family":"Miclea","given":"L"},{"family":"Stoian","given":"I"},{"family":"Enyedi","given":"S"},{"family":"Stan","given":"O"},{"family":"Stefan","given":"I"},{"family":"Raica","given":"P"},{"family":"Abrudean","given":"M"},{"family":"Valean","given":"H"},{"family":"Sanislav","given":"T"},{"family":"Gota","given":"D"}],"ISBN":"978-1-72817-166-1","ISSN":"1844-7872","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"page":"415-420","publisher":"Inst Elect & Elect Engineers; IEEE Comp Soc Test Technol Tech Council; Tech Univ Cluj Napoca; IPA R & D Insti Automat, Ctr Technol Transfer; ARQES; Bosch; Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Dept Automat; IPA R & D Insti Automat, Cluj Napoca Subsidiary; Romanian Soc Automat Control & Tech Informat","title":"Implementing Demand Response Using Smart Home IoT Devices","type":"paper-conference"},

DLTs are seen as the most promising enabler of decentralized trust, but they still lack technological maturity, and their successful adoption depends on the understanding of the fundamental design trade-offs and their reflection in the actual technical design. This work focuses on the challenges and potential solutions for an effective integration of DLTs in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT). We first introduce the landscape of IoT applications and discuss the limitations and opportunities offered by DLTs. Then we review the technical challenges encountered in the integration of resource-constrained devices with distributed trust networks. We describe the common traits of lightweight synchronization protocols, and propose a novel classification rooted in the IoT perspective. We identify the need for receiving ledger information at the endpoint devices, implying a two-way data exchange that contrasts with the conventional uplink-oriented communication technologies intended for IoT systems.","author":[{"family":"Danzi","given":"Pietro"},{"family":"Kalor","given":"Anders E."},{"family":"Sorensen","given":"Rene B."},{"family":"Hagelskjaer","given":"Alexander K."},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Lam D."},{"family":"Stefanovic","given":"Cedomir"},{"family":"Popovski","given":"Petar"}],"citation-key":"danziCommunicationAspectsIntegration2020","container-title":"IEEE NETWORK","DOI":"10.1109/MNET.001.1900180","ISSN":"0890-8044","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2]]},"page":"47-53","title":"Communication Aspects of the Integration of Wireless IoT Devices with Distributed Ledger Technology","type":"article-journal","volume":"34"},

  {"id":"davahliHybridizingGeneticAlgorithm2020","abstract":"Open wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in Internet of things (IoT) has led to many zero-day security attacks. Since intrusion detection is a key security solution, this paper presents a lightweight machine learning-based intrusion detection technique with high performance for resource limited IoT wireless networks namely, IoT intrusion detection system (IoTIDS). IoTIDS is based on hybridization of genetic algorithm (GA) and grey wolf optimizer (GWO), termed as GA–GWO. The main aim of the hybrid algorithm for the IoTIDS is to reduce the dimensionality of the huge wireless network traffic through intelligent selecting the most informative traffic features. By hybridizing, we try to eliminate their weaknesses through GA and GWO strengths. The effectiveness of the GA–GWO on IoTIDS is evaluated using AWID (aegean wi-fi intrusion dataset) as a new real-world wireless intrusion dataset, after preprocessing it under different scenarios. The experimental results proved that the proposed GA–GWO individually not only improved the performance of the IoTIDS in terms of computational costs, but it also enabled the IoTIDS to detect ? with high accuracy and low false alarm rate. Furthermore, GA–GWO in comparison to the original GA and GWO and other recent existing methods like FS, weight, and parameter optimization of SVM based on the GA (FWP-SVM-GA) and binary GWO (BGWO) has proven to be more effective.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Davahli","given":"Azam"},{"family":"Shamsi","given":"Mahboubeh"},{"family":"Abaei","given":"Golnoush"}],"citation-key":"davahliHybridizingGeneticAlgorithm2020","container-title":"Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing","container-title-short":"J Ambient Intell Human Comput","DOI":"10.1007/s12652-020-01919-x","ISSN":"1868-5137, 1868-5145","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11]]},"language":"en","page":"5581-5609","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Hybridizing genetic algorithm and grey wolf optimizer to advance an intelligent and lightweight intrusion detection system for IoT wireless networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12652-020-01919-x","volume":"11"},

Despite many advantages and applications, there are many challenges in big data to be tackled for better quality of service, e.g., big data analytics, big data management, and big data privacy and security. Blockchain with its decentralization and security nature has the great potential to improve big data services and applications. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on blockchain for big data, focusing on up-to-date approaches, opportunities, and future directions. First, we present a brief overview of blockchain and big data as well as the motivation behind their integration. Next, we survey various blockchain services for big data, including blockchain for secure big data acquisition, data storage, data analytics, and data privacy preservation.

  {"id":"demestichasDataLifecycleManagement2020","abstract":"Featured Application: This paper conducts a literature review on information and communication solutions supporting data lifecycle in precision agriculture. The role of agriculture in environmental degradation and climate change has been at the center of a long-lasting and controversial debate. This situation combined with the expected growth in crop demand and the increasing prices of fertilizers and pesticides has made the need for a more resource-efficient and environmentally sustainable agriculture more evident than ever. Precision agriculture (PA), as a relatively new farming management concept, aims to improve crop performance as well as to reduce the environmental footprint by utilizing information about the temporal and the spatial variability of crops. Information and communication technology (ICT) systems have influenced and shaped every part of modern life, and PA is no exception. The current paper conducts a literature review of prominent ICT solutions, focusing on their role in supporting different phases of the lifecycle of PA-related data. In addition to this, a data lifecycle model was developed as part of a novel categorization approach for the analyzed solutions.","author":[{"family":"Demestichas","given":"Konstantinos"},{"family":"Daskalakis","given":"Emmanouil"}],"citation-key":"demestichasDataLifecycleManagement2020","container-title":"AGRONOMY-BASEL","DOI":"10.3390/agronomy10111648","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11]]},"title":"Data Lifecycle Management in Precision Agriculture Supported by Information and Communication Technology","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"dhaiouirSystematicLiteratureReview2020","abstract":"Blockchain technology is touted to revolutionize the financial sector at the beginning of its emergence. However, its area of application has expanded to include: Supply Chain Management (SCM), healthcare, e-commerce, IoT, etc. Moreover, Smart contracts are now used by different industries not only for their high transparency and accuracy but also for their capability to exclude the third parties' involvement. Blockchain-enabled smart contracts are being adopted in different kinds of projects but still face many challenges and technical issues. This gap stems mostly from the lack of standards in smart contracts despite the Ethereum Foundation's efforts. When seeking to use this technology, it is a challenge for companies to find their way in this multiplicity. This paper is a tentative response to this problem; we conduct a systematic review of the literature and propose a preliminary guidance framework. This framework is applied to three illustrative cases to demonstrate feasibility and relevance.","author":[{"family":"Dhaiouir","given":"Samya"},{"family":"Assar","given":"Said"}],"citation-key":"dhaiouirSystematicLiteratureReview2020","collection-title":"Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing","container-title":"RESEARCH CHALLENGES IN INFORMATION SCIENCE (RCIS 2020)","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-50316-1_15","editor":[{"family":"Dalpiaz","given":"F"},{"family":"Zdravkovic","given":"J"},{"family":"Loucopoulos","given":"P"}],"ISBN":"978-3-030-50315-4 978-3-030-50316-1","ISSN":"1865-1348","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"page":"249-266","title":"A Systematic Literature Review of Blockchain-Enabled Smart Contracts: Platforms, Languages, Consensus, Applications and Choice Criteria","type":"paper-conference","volume":"385"},

  {"id":"dhakaAIoTHealthcareSystems2022","abstract":"AIoT is the melding of AI and IOT. The use of artificial intelligence in conjunction with the Internet of things is a modern trend in the field of digital devices and their respective data processing (IoT). AI is capable of giving these devices a sense of life while IoT can give them a global link. To help keep everyone informed, the system will also send information about the patient's current health status and full medical information to any family members and doctor. Preliminary stage illness prediction using data mining techniques would also allow deciding the best approach. It is anticipated that the internet of things (IoT) will combine the power of artificial intelligence, blockchain and other emerging technology in order to create future “smart hospitals.” The emerging categories of IoT devices, including adhesive sensors for skin, will make a financial contribution and will enhance the security, interoperability and analytical potential of these tools while developing technologies including block channels. By using AI to incorporate things into our environment, death rates can be substantially reduced, enabling us to identify high-risk patients early on, monitor disease spread, and predict mortality risk by examining the health history of the patient. Standardization is a major challenge in this area, with obstacles including the protection of patients' privacy, operational simplicity, portability, and low power requirements.","author":[{"family":"Dhaka","given":"Rakesh Kumar"},{"family":"Panda","given":"Sampurna"},{"family":"Panda","given":"Babita"},{"family":"Pradhan","given":"Arjyadhara"},{"family":"Jena","given":"Chitralekha"},{"family":"Nanda","given":"Lipika"}],"citation-key":"dhakaAIoTHealthcareSystems2022","container-title":"AMBIENT SCIENCE","DOI":"10.21276/ambi.2022.09.2.rv02","ISSN":"2348-5191","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"page":"55-60","title":"AIoT in Healthcare systems: a Thought on Approaches and Criticism","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"dishaPerformanceAnalysisMachine2022","abstract":"To protect the network, resources, and sensitive data, the intrusion detection system (IDS) has become a fundamental component of organizations that prevents cybercriminal activities. Several approaches have been introduced and implemented to thwart malicious activities so far. Due to the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) methods, the proposed approach applied several ML models for the intrusion detection system. In order to evaluate the performance of models, UNSW-NB 15 and Network TON_IoT datasets were used for offline analysis. Both datasets are comparatively newer than the NSL-KDD dataset to represent modern-day attacks. However, the performance analysis was carried out by training and testing the Decision Tree (DT), Gradient Boosting Tree (GBT), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), AdaBoost, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for the binary classification task. As the performance of IDS deteriorates with a high dimensional feature vector, an optimum set of features was selected through a Gini Impurity-based Weighted Random Forest (GIWRF) model as the embedded feature selection technique. This technique employed Gini impurity as the splitting criterion of trees and adjusted the weights for two different classes of the imbalanced data to make the learning algorithm understand the class distribution. Based upon the importance score, 20 features were selected from UNSW-NB 15 and 10 features from the Network TON_IoT dataset. The experimental result revealed that DT performed well with the feature selection technique than other trained models of this experiment. Moreover, the proposed GIWRF-DT outperformed other existing methods surveyed in the literature in terms of the F1 score. © 2022, The Author(s).","author":[{"family":"Disha","given":"R.

  {"id":"dorsalaBlockchainbasedSolutionsCloud2021","abstract":"Blockchain is a disruptive technology applied by academia and industry in a broad spectrum of applications ranging from cryptocurrency, financial services, IoT, 5G, risk management to public and social services. On the other hand, cloud computing is spearheading the Internet revolution and rapidly becomes the hottest topic in IT. However, cloud computing inherently suffers from centralization, lack of transparency and trust. Blockchain, with its innovative features like decentralization and immutability, adds trustworthiness and transparency to cloud computing. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of Blockchain-based cloud services literature published over the period 2008-21. This survey focuses on the technical fusion of Blockchain and cloud computing and investigates the recent advances in the field of Blockchain-based cloud computing. In particular, we classify the literature into three categories: (1) Blockchain-based Infrastructure-as-a-Service (2) Blockchainbased Platform-as-a-Service and (3) Blockchain-based Software-as-a-Service. We start by identifying a set of characteristics of Blockchain and their potential benefits to cloud computing. Then, we present our research methodology and a brief introduction of essential backgrounds. Later, we present state-of-the-art works in Blockchain-based storage-as-a-service, resource management, computation-as-a-service, data aggregation-as-aservice, microservice-as-a-service and VNF-as-a-service. We conclude the paper with the current challenges in Blockchain-based cloud computing, their potential challenges and future research directions. We believe our survey will provide a comprehensive view of the state-of-the-art Blockchain-based cloud services and facilitate reengineering the cloud data centres in the future.","author":[{"family":"Dorsala","given":"Mallikarjun Reddy"},{"family":"Sastry","given":"V.

  {"id":"doshiMachineLearningDDoS2018","abstract":"An increasing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices are connecting to the Internet, yet many of these devices are fundamentally insecure, exposing the Internet to a variety of attacks. Botnets such as Mirai have used insecure consumer IoT devices to conduct distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on critical Internet infrastructure. This motivates the development of new techniques to automatically detect consumer IoT attack traffic. In this paper, we demonstrate that using IoT-specific network behaviors (e.g., limited number of endpoints and regular time intervals between packets) to inform feature selection can result in high accuracy DDoS detection in IoT network traffic with a variety of machine learning algorithms, including neural networks. These results indicate that home gateway routers or other network middleboxes could automatically detect local IoT device sources of DDoS attacks using low-cost machine learning algorithms and traffic data that is flow-based and protocol-agnostic.","author":[{"family":"Doshi","given":"Rohan"},{"family":"Apthorpe","given":"Noah"},{"family":"Feamster","given":"Nick"}],"citation-key":"doshiMachineLearningDDoS2018","container-title":"2018 IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON SECURITY AND PRIVACY WORKSHOPS (SPW 2018)","DOI":"10.1109/SPW.2018.00013","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"page":"29-35","title":"Machine Learning DDoS Detection for Consumer Internet of Things Devices","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"douhaSurveyBlockchainSDN2022","abstract":"Due to millions of loosely coupled devices, the smart-home security is gaining the attention of industry professionals, attackers, and academic researchers. The smart home is a typical home where many sensors, actuators, and IoT devices are used to automate home users' daily activities. Although a smart home provides comfort, safety, and satisfaction to users, it opens up multiple challenging security issues when automating and offering intelligent services. Recent studies have investigated not only blockchain but SDN and NFV to address these challenges. We present a comprehensive survey on blockchain, SDN, and NFV for smart-home security. The paper also proposes a new architecture of the smart-home security. First, we describe the features of the smart home and its current security issues. Next, we outline the characteristics of blockchain, SDN, and NFV, including their contribution to improving the smart-home security. While SDN enhances the management and access control of the home network by providing a programmable controller to home nodes, NFV implements the functions of network appliances (e.g., network monitoring, firewall) as virtual machines and ensures the high availability of the network. Blockchain reinforces IoT data's privacy, integrity, and security and improves the trust in transactions among untrusted IoT devices. Finally, we discuss open issues and challenges in the field and propose recommendations towards high-level security for the smart home.","author":[{"family":"Douha","given":"N'guessan Yves-Roland"},{"family":"Bhuyan","given":"Monowar"},{"family":"Kashihara","given":"Shigeru"},{"family":"Fall","given":"Doudou"},{"family":"Taenaka","given":"Yuzo"},{"family":"Kadobayashi","given":"Youki"}],"citation-key":"douhaSurveyBlockchainSDN2022","container-title":"INTERNET OF THINGS","DOI":"10.1016/j.iot.2022.100588","ISSN":"2543-1536","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,11]]},"title":"A survey on blockchain, SDN and NFV for the smart-home security","type":"article-journal","volume":"20"},

Among the vast array of security issues plaguing the emerging loT, we decide to focus on access control, as privacy, trust, and other security properties cannot be achieved without controlled access. This article classifies loT access control solutions from the literature according to their architecture (e.g., centralized, hierarchical, federated, distributed) and examines the suitability of each one for access control purposes. Our analysis concludes that important properties such as auditability and revocation are missing from many proposals while hierarchical and federated architectures are neglected by the community. Finally, we provide an architecture-based taxonomy and future research directions: a focus on hybrid architectures, usability, flexibility, privacy, and revocation schemes in serverless authorization.","author":[{"family":"Drame-Maigne","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Laurent","given":"Maryline"},{"family":"Castillo","given":"Laurent"},{"family":"Ganem","given":"Herve"}],"citation-key":"drame-maigneCentralizedDistributedEverything2021","container-title":"ACM COMPUTING SURVEYS","DOI":"10.1145/3465170","ISSN":"0360-0300","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,9]]},"title":"Centralized, Distributed, and Everything in between: Reviewing Access Control Solutions for the loT","type":"article-journal","volume":"54"},

Federated learning enables machine learning (ML) models locally trained using private data to be aggregated into a global model. Split learning allows different portions of an ML model to be collaboratively trained on different workers in a learning framework. Federated learning and split learning, each have unique advantages and respective limitations, may complement each other toward ubiquitous intelligence in IoT. Therefore, the combination of federated learning and split learning recently became an active research area attracting extensive interest. In this article, we review the latest developments in federated learning and split learning and present a survey on the state-of-the-art technologies for combining these two learning methods in an edge computing-based IoT environment.

The teaching of Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) is no stranger to this phenomenon, and there are numerous examples of it. In order to better understand how RVTs are implemented in MSE teaching, this review presents an analysis that has been carried out after a systematic search in three different databases. This systematic search aimed to find academic works describing tools based on RVTs to improve the teaching-learning process ofMSE. The results obtained provide an overall picture of how RVTs have been used since 2010 in teaching MSE: (i) virtual reality (immersive and non-immersive) is the most widely used technology, followed at a considerable distance by augmented reality, while mixed reality is a technology that is rarely used currently; (ii) the field of MSE on which most papers have focused is Materials structure, processing, and properties. Based on this information, it is possible to open up lines of research that have not been explored until now.","author":[{"family":"Extremera","given":"J."},{"family":"Vergara","given":"D."},{"family":"Rodriguez","given":"S."}],"citation-key":"extremeraMaterialsScienceEngineering2023","collection-title":"Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems","container-title":"METHODOLOGIES AND IN℡LIGENT SYSTEMS FOR TECHNOLOGY ENHANCED LEARNING","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-031-20617-7_7","editor":[{"family":"Temperini","given":"M"},{"family":"Scarano","given":"V"},{"family":"Marenzi","given":"I"},{"family":"Kravcik","given":"M"},{"family":"Popescu","given":"E"},{"family":"Lanzilotti","given":"R"},{"family":"Gennari","given":"R"},{"family":"DeLa Prieta","given":"F"},{"family":"DiMascio","given":"T"},{"family":"Vittorini","given":"P"}],"ISBN":"978-3-031-20616-0 978-3-031-20617-7","ISSN":"2367-3370","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023]]},"page":"48-58","title":"Materials Science and Engineering Education Based on Reality-Virtuality Technologies","type":"paper-conference","volume":"580"},

Despite all valuable efforts, DSC has still a long way ahead to be known, understood and implemented all over a supply chain. Therefore, this study presents a literature review of 107 papers on DSC to clarify its definition in addition to provide insight on the most prominent components of a DSC framework. It is done by updating previous literature reviews and conducting a classification and thematic analysis on the reviewed papers. Moreover, in order to have more specific look on building blocks of DSC, a framework for digital supply chain is designed considering the value stream in DSC. The framework consists of several layers, including DSC strategies, enablers, processes, data management and analytics, DSC flows and DSC features. These components work seamlessly to provide virtual values for customers and other stakeholders. Finally, managerial implications and future research directions are remarked.","author":[{"family":"Farajpour","given":"Farnoush"},{"family":"Hassanzadeh","given":"Alireza"},{"family":"Elahi","given":"Shaban"},{"family":"Ghazanfari","given":"Mehdi"}],"citation-key":"farajpourDigitalSupplyChain2022","container-title":"TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE","DOI":"10.1016/j.techfore.2022.121976","ISSN":"0040-1625","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,11]]},"title":"Digital supply chain blueprint via a systematic literature review","type":"article-journal","volume":"184"},

These technologies will improve processing efficiency, the creation of business opportunities, requirement regulation, information security, and transparency. While sharing electronic health records can assist in improving diagnosis accuracy, privacy and security preservation are imperative. In the network of IoT devices, that exchange involves sensitive medical data; patient monitoring has to be totally secured against privacy risks and attacks. Delays in treatment progress and emergency treatments could also result in medical data security and confidentiality violations. Applying blockchain technology to the healthcare industry could improve information security management; healthcare data could be analyzed and communicated while preserving the privacy and security of the data.

After that, we present an alternative feature selection (FS) approach using the recently developed SI algorithm, Aquila optimizer (AQU). Moreover, to assess the quality of the developed IDS approach, four well-known public datasets, CIC2017, NSL-KDD, BoT-IoT, and KDD99, were used. We also considered extensive comparisons to other optimization methods to verify the competitive performance of the developed method.

With these developments, cyberattacks are also rapidly growing since the current security mechanisms do not provide efficient solutions. Recently, various artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions have been proposed for different security applications, including intrusion detection. In this paper, we propose an efficient AI-based mechanism for intrusion detection systems (IDS) in IoT systems. We leverage the advancements of deep learnings and metaheuristics (MH) algorithms that approved their efficiency in solving complex engineering problems. We propose a feature extraction method using the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract relevant features. Also, we develop a new feature selection method using a new variant of the transient search optimization (TSO) algorithm, called TSODE, using the operators of differential evolution (DE) algorithm. The proposed TSODE uses the DE to improve the process of balancing between exploitation and exploration phases. Furthermore, we use three public datasets, KDDCup-99, NSL-KDD, BoT-IoT, and CICIDS-2017 to assess the performance of the developed method, which achieved higher accuracy compared to several existing approaches.","author":[{"family":"Fatani","given":"Abdulaziz"},{"family":"Abd Elaziz","given":"Mohamed"},{"family":"Dahou","given":"Abdelghani"},{"family":"Al-Qaness","given":"Mohammed A.

  {"id":"fengCRBFTOptimizedBlockchain2022","abstract":"In this article, a credit identity ring optimization blockchain algorithm (CRBFT) based on practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) is proposed to address the security problem for the network of Internet of Things (IoT). The contributions of this work are given as follows. First, combined with the edge computing architecture, CRBFT introduces the improved credit grading protocol and the improved ring signature scheme into the blockchain network, rewards or punishes the nodes through their behavior, changes the way of selecting the primary node, and ensures that the identity of the primary node will not be disclosed, so as to prevent the primary node from adaptive attack by Byzantine nodes, improve the reliability of the nodes participating in the consensus, and enhance the security of the system. Second, in order to reduce the communication traffic among nodes, CRBFT optimizes the consensus protocol, which not only reduces the time complexity of the traffic in the consensus stage from O (n(2)) to O (n) but also improves the consensus efficiency of the system while ensuring the system security. Finally, CRBFT aims to measure the performance of CRBFT. This article is simulated and tested in three aspects: throughput (transactions per second), consistency delay, and communication overhead. Performance evaluation shows that CRBFT achieves lower communication overhead than PBFT. When the number of nodes is the same, CRBFT can obtain higher TPS and lower consistency delay. The results show that compared with PBFT, CRBFT can provide very competitive results.","author":[{"family":"Feng","given":"Minyu"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Jiali"},{"family":"He","given":"Siyi"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Jincheng"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Yixin"}],"citation-key":"fengCRBFTOptimizedBlockchain2022","container-title":"IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL","DOI":"10.1109/JSEN.2022.3215152","ISSN":"1530-437X","issue":"23","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,1]]},"page":"23200-23208","title":"CRBFT: An Optimized Blockchain Algorithm for Edge-Based IoT System","type":"article-journal","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"fernandez-caramesPreQuantumPostQuantumIoT2020","abstract":"Although quantum computing is still in its nascent age, its evolution threatens the most popular public-key encryption systems. Such systems are essential for today's Internet security due to their ability for solving the key distribution problem and for providing high security in insecure communications channels that allow for accessing websites or for exchanging e-mails, financial transactions, digitally signed documents, military communications or medical data. Cryptosystems like Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA), elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) or Diffie-Hellman have spread worldwide and are part of diverse key Internet standards like Transport Layer Security (TLS), which are used both by traditional computers and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It is especially difficult to provide high security to IoT devices, mainly because many of them rely on batteries and are resource constrained in terms of computational power and memory, which implies that specific energy-efficient and lightweight algorithms need to be designed and implemented for them. These restrictions become relevant challenges when implementing cryptosystems that involve intensive mathematical operations and demand substantial computational resources, which are often required in applications where data privacy has to be preserved for the long term, like IoT applications for defense, mission-critical scenarios or smart healthcare. Quantum computing threatens such a long-term IoT device security and researchers are currently developing solutions to mitigate such a threat. This article provides a survey on what can be called post-quantum IoT systems (IoT systems protected from the currently known quantum computing attacks): the main post-quantum cryptosystems and initiatives are reviewed, the most relevant IoT architectures and challenges are analyzed, and the expected future trends are indicated. Thus, this article is aimed at providing a wide view of post-quantum IoT security and give useful guidelines to the future post-quantum IoT developers.","author":[{"family":"Fernandez-Carames","given":"Tiago M."}],"citation-key":"fernandez-caramesPreQuantumPostQuantumIoT2020","container-title":"IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL","DOI":"10.1109/JIOT.2019.2958788","ISSN":"2327-4662","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7]]},"page":"6457-6480","title":"From Pre-Quantum to Post-Quantum IoT Security: A Survey on Quantum-Resistant Cryptosystems for the Internet of Things","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"fernandez-vazquezBlockchainSustainableSupply2022","abstract":"Purpose The analytical hierarchical process (AHP)'s main purpose is to assess higher hierarchy levels based on the cooperation of its various levels. It results in a well-designed model-based method in which the weights for the selected attribute are calculated using dimensions, criteria, and indicators. This paper aims to highlight the benefits of blockchain in supply chain management with the help of a literature review along with opinions of experts from various sectors. Design/methodology/approach With the goal of enhancing the use of blockchain technology in supply chain management, particularly when comparing within the same industry, the AHP methodology has been used. In order to develop the AHP model, a total of eight elements are examined in this study, which are decentralization, resiliency, security, smart contracts, sustainability, traceability, transparency and trust. A calculation of a Desirability Index for conventional supply chain and blockchain-enabled supply chains has been also developed. Findings Findings where that in a blockchain-enabled supply chain, the global weights of individual benefit variables are considerably larger than in conventional supply chains. When the score of the Desirability Index for conventional supply chain and blockchain-enabled supply chain is compared, the blockchain-enabled supply chain significantly surpasses the conventional supply chain in terms of increasing sustainable development in today's supply networks. Originality/value This study takes into account the AHP methodology applying it on blockchain. This has not been done before in the academic world, at least as far as the authors may be aware of. The originality of combining such process with a recent technology such as blockchain highlights the value of this research.","author":[{"family":"Fernandez-Vazquez","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Rosillo","given":"Rafael"},{"family":"Fuente","given":"David","non-dropping-particle":"de la"},{"family":"Puente","given":"Javier"}],"citation-key":"fernandez-vazquezBlockchainSustainableSupply2022","container-title":"BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL","DOI":"10.1108/BPMJ-11-2021-0750","ISSN":"1463-7154","issue":"5/6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,14]]},"page":"1277-1300","title":"Blockchain in sustainable supply chain management: an application of the analytical hierarchical process (AHP) methodology","type":"article-journal","volume":"28"},

There have been various attempts to manage COVID-19 and other pandemics using technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G/6G communications. However, we also need to ensure that IoT devices used to facilitate COVID-19 monitoring and treatment (e.g., medical IoT devices) are secured, as the compromise of such devices can have significant consequences (e.g., life-threatening risks to COVID-19 patients). Hence, in this paper we comprehensively survey existing IoT-related solutions, potential security and privacy risks and their requirements. For example, we classify existing security and privacy solutions into five categories, namely: authentication and access control solutions, key management and cryptography solutions, blockchain-based solutions, intrusion detection systems, and privacy-preserving solutions. In each category, we identify the associated challenges. We also identify a number of recommendations to inform future research.","author":[{"family":"Ferrag","given":"Mohamed Amine"},{"family":"Shu","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Choo","given":"Kim-Kwang Raymond"}],"citation-key":"ferragFightingCOVID19Future2021","container-title":"IEEE-CAA JOURNAL OF AUTOMATICA SINICA","DOI":"10.1109/JAS.2021.1004087","ISSN":"2329-9266","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,9]]},"page":"1477-1499","title":"Fighting COVID-19 and Future Pandemics With the Internet of Things: Security and Privacy Perspectives","type":"article-journal","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"gaberInjectionAttackDetection2022","abstract":"Smart cities are a rapidly growing IoT application. These smart cities mainly rely on wireless sensors to connect their different components (smart devices) together. Smart cities rely on the integration of IoT and 5G technologies, and this has created a demand for a massive IoT network of connected devices. The data traffic coming from indoor wireless networks (e.g., smart homes, smart hospitals, smart factories, or smart school buildings) contributes to over 80% of the total data traffic of the current IoT network. As smart cities and their applications grow, security and privacy challenges have become a major concern for billions of IoT smart devices. One reason for this could be the oversight of handling security issues of IoT devices by their manufacturers, which enables attackers to exploit the vulnerabilities in these devices by performing different types of attacks, e.g., DDoS and injection attacks. Intrusion detection is one way to detect and mitigate the risk of such attacks. In this paper, an intrusion detection method was proposed to detect injection attacks in IoT applications (e.g. smart cities). In this method, two types of feature selection techniques (constant removal and recursive feature elimination) were used and tested by a number of machine learning classifiers (i.e., SVM, Random Forest, and Decision Tree). The T-Test was conducted to evaluate the quality of this proposed feature selection method. Using the public dataset, AWID, the evaluation results showed that the decision tree classifier can be used to detect injection attacks with an accuracy of 99% using only 8 features, which were selected using the proposed feature selection method. Also, the comparison with the most related work showed the advantages of the proposed intrusion detection method. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

  {"id":"gadDistributedIntrusionDetection2022","abstract":"The internet of things (IoT) is a collection of common physical things which can communicate and synthesize data utilizing network infrastructure by connecting to the internet. IoT networks are increasingly vulnerable to security breaches as their popularity grows. Cyber security attacks are among the most popular severe dangers to IoT security. Many academics are increasingly interested in enhancing the security of IoT systems. Machine learning (ML) approaches were employed to function as intrusion detection systems (IDSs) to provide better security capabilities. This work proposed a novel distributed detection system based on machine ML approaches to detect attacks in IoT and mitigate malicious occurrences. Furthermore, NSL-KDD or KDD-CUP99 datasets are used in the great majority of current studies. These datasets are not updated with new attacks. As a consequence, the ToN-IoT dataset was used for training and testing. It was created from a large-scale, diverse IoT network. The ToN-IoT dataset reflects data from each layer of the IoT system, such as cloud, fog, and edge layer. Various ML methods were tested in each specific partition of the ToN-IoT dataset. The proposed model is the first suggested model based on the collected data from the same IoT system from all layers. The Chi2 technique was used to pick features in a network dataset. It reduced the number of features to 20. Another feature selection tool employed in the windows dataset was the correlation matrix, which was used to extract the most relevant features from the whole dataset. To balance the classes, the SMOTE method was used. This paper tests numerous ML approaches in both binary and multi-class classification problems. According to the findings, the XGBoost approach is superior to other ML algorithms for each node in the suggested model.","author":[{"family":"Gad","given":"Abdallah R."},{"family":"Haggag","given":"Mohamed"},{"family":"Nashat","given":"Ahmed A."},{"family":"Barakat","given":"Tamer M."}],"citation-key":"gadDistributedIntrusionDetection2022","container-title":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,6]]},"page":"548-563","title":"A Distributed Intrusion Detection System using Machine Learning for IoT based on ToN-IoT Dataset","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"gadIntrusionDetectionSystem2021","abstract":"Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are a subsystem of the proposed intelligent transportation system (ITS) that enables vehicles to communicate over the wireless communication infrastructure. VANETs are used in multiple applications, such as improving trafﬁc safety and collision prevention. The use of VANETs makes the network vulnerable to various types of attacks, such as denial of service (DoS) and distributed denial of service (DDoS). Many researchers are now interested in adding a high level of security to VANETs. Machine learning (ML) methods were used for constructing a high level of security capabilities based on intrusion detection systems (IDSs). Furthermore, the vast majority of existing research is based on NSL-KDD or KDD-CUP99 datasets. Recent attacks are not present in these datasets. As a result, we employed a realistic dataset called ToN-IoT that derived from a large-scale, heterogeneous IoT network.

Many ports are open by default and default user credentials are left unchanged. To tackle the increasingly popular botnet attack, many detection approaches have been proposed. However, most of them are targeting on one particular approach or one botnet dataset. There is lacking a comprehensive comparison between different machine learning and deep learning approaches on this task under different datasets collected from different ways. In this work, we have measured the performance of 5 machine learning and 2 deep learning based approaches on 4 recently published IoT botnet datasets collected using real and virtual IoT devices under Mirai malware attack.

Based on the situational awareness framework, the experimental results of the effect of these personalized service recommendations show that the load factor is greater than 0.6, which indicates that the dimensions of a scalar can explain situational awareness. The P-value > 0.01 shows that the mobile library is linear and related to the user, mobile, resource, and service scenarios.

  {"id":"georgeGMLedgerBlockchainBasedCertificate2023","abstract":"Maritime transportation plays a critical role for many Arab countries and their food security and has evolved into a complex system that involves a plethora of supply chain stakeholders spread around the globe. This inherent complexity brings huge security challenges, including cargo loss and high burdens in cargo document inspection. The emerging blockchain technology provides a promising tool to build a unified maritime cargo tracking system critical for cargo security. This is because blockchains are a tamper-proof distributed ledger technology that can store and track data in a secure and transparent manner. Using the State of Qatar as a case study, this research introduces the Global Maritime Ledger (GM-Ledger), which will aid authorities in verifying, signing and transacting food certificates in an efficient manner. The methodology of this research includes reviewing past publications, identifying the requirements of various players in the Qatari food import-export industry and then creating a smart contract framework that will efficiently manage the work with necessary human intervention as and when required. The result of this work is the formation of a solid framework that can be employed in future works. This work realized that employing web3 solutions for the food import sector is highly viable and that with the right social, economic and policy reforms, it is possible to transform the entire food system to bear healthy transparency and power balance in global supply chains. In conclusion, this study argues that BCT has the ability to assist the government and other players to minimize fraud and maximize food supply chain stakeholder participation.","author":[{"family":"George","given":"William"},{"family":"Al-Ansari","given":"Tareq"}],"citation-key":"georgeGMLedgerBlockchainBasedCertificate2023","container-title":"FOODS","DOI":"10.3390/foods12213914","issue":"21","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,11]]},"title":"GM-Ledger: Blockchain-Based Certificate Authentication for International Food Trade","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"geSemiautonomousDistributedBlockchainbased2020","abstract":"The impact of the Internet of Things (IoT) to our daily life has become bigger than ever, which can be witnessed from smart homes, smart transportation, and smart personal care. With widespread applications of UAVs in IoT contexts such as delivery and military, protecting communications between UAVs and ground control system is needed so as to resist potential vulnerabilities and optimize the coordination between distributed UAVs. In this work, to secure communications during data acquisition and transmission, as well as diminish the probability of attacking by malicious manipulated UAVs, we propose a distributed UAVs scheme harnessing blockchain technology whose network has similar topology to IoT along with cloud server. Instead of directly using the typical blockchain technique which requires expensive computation and high bandwidth overhead, we propose a novel, secure, and lightweight blockchain architecture which mitigates the computation and storage overhead while retaining its privacy and security benefits. Moreover, multiples types of transactions are defined to describe various data access and a novel reputation-based consensus protocol is designed to ensure the reliability of the decentralized network. Finally, performance evaluation demonstrates our blockchain-based distributed scheme is secure and efficient.","author":[{"family":"Ge","given":"Chunpeng"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Xinshu"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Zhe"}],"citation-key":"geSemiautonomousDistributedBlockchainbased2020","container-title":"JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE","DOI":"10.1016/j.sysarc.2020.101728","ISSN":"1383-7621","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,8]]},"title":"A semi-autonomous distributed blockchain-based framework for UAVs system","type":"article-journal","volume":"107"},
  {"id":"ghaffariDistributedLedgerTechnologies2023","abstract":"The accelerated growth of networking technologies highlights the importance of Authentication and Access Control (AAC) as protection against associated attacks. Controlling access to resources, facilitat-ing resource sharing, and managing user mobility are some of the notable capabilities provided by AAC methods. Centralized methods are the most common deployment architectures, that can be threatened by several attacks at their central points. Emerging Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) has attracted significant interest in the AAA community. The distributed nature of DLT and its immutability can bring unprecedented opportunities to resolve many of the challenges of conventional systems. We survey the state-of-the-art in deploying authentication and access control approaches via DLT for several networking use cases. More precisely, we explore DLT applications in (1) Authentication; (2) Access Control; and (3) Comprehensive AAC solutions. First, we present the challenges of centralized solutions and discuss the capability of DLT for their resolution. Then, we propose a taxonomy to categorize the existing methods. Analysis, comparison, and discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of these methods have been provided regarding different parameters such as DLT types, AAC approaches, security, reliability, scalability, etc. While DLT provides various benefits, several challenges remain for the migration to DLT-based AAC. In light of these general limitations, we propose some future directions, targeting the current lacunae and future needs.","author":[{"family":"Ghaffari","given":"Fariba"},{"family":"Bertin","given":"Emmanuel"},{"family":"Crespi","given":"Noel"},{"family":"Hatin","given":"Julien"}],"citation-key":"ghaffariDistributedLedgerTechnologies2023","container-title":"COMPUTER SCIENCE REVIEW","DOI":"10.1016/j.cosrev.2023.100590","ISSN":"1574-0137","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,11]]},"title":"Distributed ledger technologies for authentication and access control in networking applications: A comprehensive survey","type":"article-journal","volume":"50"},

  {"id":"ghimireBlockchainAdditiveManufacturing2022","abstract":"ABSTR A C T The concept of Industry 4.0 was conceived to make manufacturing and industrial processes more modern and sustainable. It is achieved through the use of emerging technologies such as IoT, additive manufac-turing, and robotics. One such technology is Blockchain, which provides many benefits like security, decentralization, and transparency. Blockchain was first proposed in the year 2008 as the technology behind the now-famous cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Since then, blockchain technology has seen a lot of improvements and changes. Blockchain has also branched out from its digital currencies to other indus-tries such as healthcare, governance, supply chain, and entertainment. This article focuses on how and why blockchain technology can be used in conjunction with additive manufacturing and other new tech-nologies to keep up with the current manufacturing demands of consumers. This article zeros in on the existing problems in the manufacturing industry and how blockchain and additive manufacturing can be used to mitigate them and provides rough guidelines for future researchers or organizations looking to integrate Blockchain into their supply chain.

  {"id":"ghoshPatternsTrendsInternet2021","abstract":"Purpose The Internet of Things (IoT) provides exciting opportunities for the construction industry to solve its time and resource constraints and frequent defaults. This study seeks to identify and rank the perceived importance level of principal research areas associated with the IoT and the construction industry by utilising a scientific mapping tool (i.e. VOSviewer). Such knowledge would enable key drivers for successful adoption of the IoT and digitisation technologies to be outlined. An analysis of key drivers and research trends that facilitates the development of a roadmap for applying the IoT and digital technologies in the construction sector is therefore much needed. Design/methodology/approach An interpretivist philosophical lens was adopted to analyse published work as secondary data, where each publication represented a unit of analysis. A total of 417 peer-reviewed journal review articles covering the IoT within the construction domain were systematically reviewed using a mixed-methods approach, utilising qualitative-scientometric analyses techniques. Findings The results revealed a field of study in a fledgling stage, with a limited number of experts operating somewhat in isolation and offering single-point solutions instead of taking an integrated “holistic” approach. Key publication outlets were identified and the main focus of research undertaken being in the technical areas of smart buildings, smart construction objects and environmental sustainability. The major effects of adopting the IoT within the construction industry were identified as high-speed reporting, complete process control, data explosion leading to deep data analytics, strict ethical and legal expectations. Key drivers of the IoT adoption were outlined: interoperability; data privacy and security; flexible governance structures; proper business planning and models. Practical implications The study benefits researchers and industry practitioners alike. For researchers, the identified gaps reveal areas of high priority in future research. For construction companies, particularly small to medium-sized businesses, the study raises awareness of the latest developments and potential applicability of the IoT in the industry. For government agencies and policymakers, this study offers a point of reference in directing the adoption of the IoT smoothly in the construction sector and provides guidelines and standards for maximising the potential benefits. Originality/value The study is the first scientometric review of the existing body of knowledge in the context of application of the IoT in the construction industry. Findings expose knowledge gaps in contemporary research, specifically, a broader consideration of organisational adjustments needed to accommodate the IoT usage, economic analyses and impediments to wider acceptance.","author":[{"family":"Ghosh","given":"Arka"},{"family":"Edwards","given":"David John"},{"family":"Hosseini","given":"M.

  {"id":"gkonisSurveyIoTEdgeCloudContinuum2023","abstract":"The rapid growth in the number of interconnected devices on the Internet (referred to as the Internet of Things-IoT), along with the huge volume of data that are exchanged and processed, has created a new landscape in network design and operation. Due to the limited battery size and computational capabilities of IoT nodes, data processing usually takes place on external devices. Since latency minimization is a key concept in modern-era networks, edge servers that are in close proximity to IoT nodes gather and process related data, while in some cases data offloading in the cloud might have to take place. The interconnection of a vast number of heterogeneous IoT devices with the edge servers and the cloud, where the IoT, edge, and cloud converge to form a computing continuum, is also known as the IoT-edge-cloud (IEC) continuum. Several key challenges are associated with this new computing systems' architectural approach, including (i) the design of connection and programming protocols aimed at properly manipulating a huge number of heterogeneous devices over diverse infrastructures; (ii) the design of efficient task offloading algorithms aimed at optimizing services execution; (iii) the support for security and privacy enhancements during data transfer to deal with the existent and even unforeseen attacks and threats landscape; (iv) scalability, flexibility, and reliability guarantees to face the expected mobility for IoT systems; and (v) the design of optimal resource allocation mechanisms to make the most out of the available resources. These challenges will become even more significant towards the new era of sixth-generation (6G) networks, which will be based on the integration of various cutting-edge heterogeneous technologies. Therefore, the goal of this survey paper is to present all recent developments in the field of IEC continuum systems, with respect to the aforementioned deployment challenges. In the same context, potential limitations and future challenges are highlighted as well. Finally, indicative use cases are also presented from an IEC continuum perspective.","author":[{"family":"Gkonis","given":"Panagiotis"},{"family":"Giannopoulos","given":"Anastasios"},{"family":"Trakadas","given":"Panagiotis"},{"family":"Masip-Bruin","given":"Xavi"},{"family":"D'Andria","given":"Francesco"}],"citation-key":"gkonisSurveyIoTEdgeCloudContinuum2023","container-title":"FUTURE INTERNET","DOI":"10.3390/fi15120383","ISSN":"1999-5903","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,12]]},"title":"A Survey on IoT-Edge-Cloud Continuum Systems: Status, Challenges, Use Cases, and Open Issues","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"gongIndepthSystematicLiterature2022","abstract":"Cloud computing enables businesses to decrease the total costs by outsourcing their required services. Therefore, it provides a new challenge of data protection regarding reliability, integrity, and confidentiality because of outsourcing. As a result, cloud security is becoming a key differentiator and competitive edge between cloud providers. Nowadays, the use of blockchain in cloud computing is one of the most common innovations that can solve cloud computing security problems. Blockchain is a decentralized data management technology to provide security, anonymity, and data integrity without any third-party organization. This work presents a comprehensive study of cloud computing security concerns and blockchain solutions to address these concerns. Applying different filters and searching international databases, 21 articles from reputable journals are found and reviewed.

  {"id":"gonzalez-brionesReviewMainMachine2019","abstract":"The ability to predict future energy consumption is very important for energy distribution companies because it allows them to estimate energy needs and supply them accordingly. Consumption prediction makes it possible for those companies to optimize their processes by, for example, providing them with knowledge about future periods of high energy demand or by enabling them to adapt their tariffs to customer consumption. Machine Learning techniques allow to predict future energy consumption on the basis of the customers' historical consumption and several other parameters. This article reviews some of the main machine learning models capable of predicting energy consumption, in our case study we use a specific set of data extracted from a two-year-period of a shoe store. Among the evaluated methods, Gradient Boosting has obtained an 86.3% success rate in predicting consumption.","author":[{"family":"Gonzalez-Briones","given":"Alfonso"},{"family":"Hernandez","given":"Guillermo"},{"family":"Pinto","given":"Tiago"},{"family":"Vale","given":"Zita"},{"family":"Corchado","given":"Juan M."}],"citation-key":"gonzalez-brionesReviewMainMachine2019","collection-title":"International Conference on the European Energy Market","container-title":"2019 16TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE EUROPEAN ENERGY MARKET (EEM)","DOI":"10.1109/eem.2019.8916406","ISBN":"978-1-72811-257-2","ISSN":"2165-4077","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"title":"A Review of the Main Machine Learning Methods for Predicting Residential Energy Consumption","type":"paper-conference"},

Machine learning methods have demonstrated promising results for the detection of such attacks. However, the effectiveness of such methods may greatly beneﬁt from the reduction of feature set size as this may prevent the impeding impact of unnecessary features and minimize the computational resources required for intrusion detection in such networks having several limitations. This paper elaborates on feature selection methods applied to machine learning models which are induced for botnet detection in IoT networks. A particular attention is devoted to the use of wrapper methods and their combination with ﬁlter methods. While ﬁlterbased feature selection methods provide a computationally light approach to select the most informative features, it is shown that their utilization in combination with wrapper methods boosts up the detection accuracy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Guerra-Manzanares","given":"Alejandro"},{"family":"Bahsi","given":"Hayretdin"},{"family":"Nomm","given":"Sven"}],"citation-key":"guerra-manzanaresHybridFeatureSelection2019","container-title":"2019 International Conference on Cyberworlds (CW)","DOI":"10.1109/CW.2019.00059","event-place":"Kyoto, Japan","event-title":"2019 International Conference on Cyberworlds (CW)","ISBN":"978-1-72812-297-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,10]]},"language":"en","page":"324-327","publisher":"IEEE","publisher-place":"Kyoto, Japan","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Hybrid Feature Selection Models for Machine Learning Based Botnet Detection in IoT Networks","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8919099/"},
  {"id":"guerra-manzanaresIntegrationPostHocInterpretation2019","abstract":"The analysis of the interplay between the feature selection and the post-hoc local interpretation steps in a machine learning workflow followed for IoT botnet detection constitutes the research scope of the present paper. While the application of machine learning-based techniques has become a trend in cyber security, the main focus has been almost on detection accuracy. However, providing the relevant explanation for a detection decision is a vital requirement in a tiered incident handling processes of the contemporary security operations centers. Moreover, the design of intrusion detection systems in IoT networks has to take the limitations of the computational resources into consideration. Therefore, resource limitations in addition to human element of incident handling necessitate considering feature selection and interpretability at the same time in machine learning workflows. In this paper, first, we analyzed the selection of features and its implication on the data accuracy. Second, we investigated the impact of feature selection on the explanations generated at the post-hoc interpretation phase. We utilized a filter method, Fisher's Score and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation (LIME) at feature selection and post-hoc interpretation phases, respectively. To evaluate the quality of explanations, we proposed a metric that reflects the need of the security analysts. It is demonstrated that the application of both steps for the particular case of IoT botnet detection may result in highly accurate and interpretable learning models induced by fewer features. Our metric enables us to evaluate the detection accuracy and interpretability in an integrated way.","author":[{"family":"Guerra-Manzanares","given":"Alejandro"},{"family":"Nõmm","given":"Sven"},{"family":"Bahsi","given":"Hayretdin"}],"citation-key":"guerra-manzanaresIntegrationPostHocInterpretation2019","container-title":"2019 18th IEEE International Conference On Machine Learning And Applications (ICMLA)","DOI":"10.1109/ICMLA.2019.00193","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12]]},"page":"1162-1169","title":"Towards the Integration of a Post-Hoc Interpretation Step into the Machine Learning Workflow for IoT Botnet Detection","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"gultekinSystematicLiteratureReview2022","abstract":"Internet of Things(IoT) is a concept that develops day by day and is now an indispensable part of our lives. Although it has been developed a lot, it still has many problematic areas and has many aspects that need improvement. On the other hand, data provenance is a concept that covers the origin of the data, the changes made, and the processes it has gone through. Data provenance is an essential option for improvements in the IoT field. Although there are many research studies in the literature related to the use of data provenance in the IoT, we could not identify a comprehensive systematic literature review that focuses explicitly on this topic. The study aims to examine the current data provenance on the Internet of Things studies, identify potential shortcomings or improvements, determine the working areas that can be done to make the processes more efficient and solve the IoT and data provenance problems. We also aim to serve this study as a knowledge base for researchers for conducting further research and development in this area. The review is done by following a systematic literature review process. We presented an SLR-based method on data provenance in IoT. We investigated the challenges encountered in IoT applications and worked on using data provenance as a solution. We conducted a literature search covering the years 2012-2022. We found 140 published papers. After applying exclusion criteria for these papers, we have focused on the final 16 papers. In the IoT area, some challenges require work, such as constrained resources, heterogeneity, scalability, mobility, security and privacy. Our study shows that data provenance is primarily used in security, privacy, reliability, and trust. We can say that the studies in these fields have increased gradually over the last years. Blockchain is frequently used to provide data provenance.","author":[{"family":"Gultekin","given":"Emrullah"},{"family":"Aktas","given":"Mehmet S."}],"citation-key":"gultekinSystematicLiteratureReview2022","collection-title":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science","container-title":"COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND ITS APPLICATIONS - ICCSA 2022 WORKSHOPS, PART IV","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-031-10542-5_3","editor":[{"family":"Gervasi","given":"O"},{"family":"Murgante","given":"B"},{"family":"Misra","given":"S"},{"family":"Rocha","given":"AMAC"},{"family":"Garau","given":"C"}],"ISBN":"978-3-031-10542-5 978-3-031-10541-8","ISSN":"0302-9743","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"page":"31-46","publisher":"Springer Int Publishing AG; Comp Open Access Journal; Computat Open Access Journal; Univ Malaga; Univ Perugia; Univ Basilicata; Monash Univ; Kyushu Sangyo Univ; Univ Minho; Univ Cagliari","title":"Systematic Literature Review on Data Provenance in Internet of Things","type":"paper-conference","volume":"13380"},

  {"id":"guoMachineLearningFramework2021","abstract":"During the recent years, there has been an escalated growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices in our daily lives. Due to their inherent vulnerabilities, IoT networks are more susceptible to cyberattacks. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) can provide a powerful defensive capability against security threats for IoT systems. Among various approaches for detecting malicious activities in IDSs, Machine Learning (ML) techniques have attracted significant attention in the research community. In this study, we propose an ML-based IDS framework based on a novel feature selection method for anomaly detection in IoT networks. The framework is evaluated by employing seven popular ML classification algorithms on TON_IoT network dataset with regard to accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and execution times. Finally, the results of the experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed IDS and the best performing ML classifiers. © 2021 IEEE.","author":[{"family":"Guo","given":"G."}],"citation-key":"guoMachineLearningFramework2021","container-title":"2021 IEEE 12th Annual Information Technology, Electronics and Mobile Communication Conference, IEMCON 2021","DOI":"10.1109/IEMCON53756.2021.9623082","editor":[{"family":"Chakrabarti S.","given":"Paul R."}],"ISBN":"978-1-66540-066-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"English","page":"593-599","publisher":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","title":"A Machine Learning Framework for Intrusion Detection System in IoT Networks Using an Ensemble Feature Selection Method","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123570716&doi=10.1109%2fIEMCON53756.2021.9623082&partnerID=40&md5=991aba09865ba52589aba7f6c0d4fb14"},

  {"id":"guruSurveyConsensusProtocols2023","abstract":"In the current era, blockchain has approximately 30 consensus algorithms. This architecturally distributed database stores data in an encrypted form with multiple checks, including elliptical curve cryptography (ECC) and Merkle hash tree. Additionally, many researchers aim to implement a public key infrastructure (PKI) cryptography mechanism to boost the security of blockchain-based data management. However, the issue is that many of these are required for advanced cryptographic protocols. For all consensus protocols, security features are required to be discussed because these consensus algorithms have recently been attacked by address resolution protocols (ARP), distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS), and sharding attacks in a permission-less blockchain. The existence of a byzantine adversary is perilous, and is involved in these ongoing attacks. Considering the above issues, we conducted an informative survey based on the consensus protocol attack on blockchain through the latest published article from IEEE, Springer, Elsevier, ACM, Willy, Hindawi, and other publishers. We incorporate various methods involved in blockchain. Our main intention is to gain clarity from earlier published articles to elaborate numerous key methods in terms of a survey article.","author":[{"family":"Guru","given":"Abhishek"},{"family":"Mohanta","given":"Bhabendu Kumar"},{"family":"Mohapatra","given":"Hitesh"},{"family":"Al-Turjman","given":"Fadi"},{"family":"Altrjman","given":"Chadi"},{"family":"Yadav","given":"Arvind"}],"citation-key":"guruSurveyConsensusProtocols2023","container-title":"APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL","DOI":"10.3390/app13042604","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,2]]},"title":"A Survey on Consensus Protocols and Attacks on Blockchain Technology","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"haddadSystematicReviewAIBlockchain2022","abstract":"Electronic health records (EHRs) are digitally saved health records that provide information about a person's health. EHRs are generally shared among healthcare stakeholders, and thus are susceptible to power failures, data misuse, a lack of privacy, security, and an audit trail, among other problems. Blockchain, on the other hand, is a groundbreaking technology that provides a distributed and decentralized environment in which nodes in a list of networks can connect to each other without the need for a central authority. It has the potential to overcome the limits of EHR management and create a more secure, decentralized, and safer environment for exchanging EHR data. Further, blockchain is a distributed ledger on which data can be stored and shared in a cryptographically secure, validated, and mutually agreed-upon manner across all mining nodes. The blockchain stores data with a high level of integrity and robustness, and it cannot be altered. When smart contracts are used to make decisions and conduct analytics with machine-learning algorithms, the results may be trusted and unquestioned. However, Blockchain is not always indestructible and suffers from scalability and complexity issues that might render it inefficient. Combining AI and blockchain technology can handled some of the drawbacks of these two technical ecosystems effectively. AI algorithms rely on data or information to learn, analyze, and reach conclusions. The performance of AI algorithms is enhanced through the data obtained from a data repository or a reliable, secure, trustworthy, and credible platform. Researchers have identified three categories of blockchain-based potential solutions for the management of electronic health records: conceptual, prototype, and implemented. The purpose of this research work is to conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify and assess research articles that were either conceptual or implemented to manage EHRs using blockchain technology. The study conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the literature on blockchain technology and enhanced health record management systems utilizing artificial intelligence technologies. The study examined 189 research papers collected from various publication categories. The in-depth analysis focuses on the privacy, security, accessibility, and scalability of publications. The SLR has illustrated that blockchain technology has the potential to deliver decentralization, security, and privacy that are frequently lacking in traditional EHRs. Additionally, the outcomes of the extensive analysis inform future researchers about the type of blockchain to use in their research. Additionally, methods used in healthcare are summarized per application area while their pros and cons are highlighted. Finally, the emphasized taxonomy combines blockchain and artificial intelligence, which enables us to analyze possible blockchain and artificial intelligence applications in health records management systems. The article ends with a discussion on open issues for research and future directions.","author":[{"family":"Haddad","given":"Alaa"},{"family":"Habaebi","given":"Mohamed Hadi"},{"family":"Islam","given":"Md Rafiqul"},{"family":"Hasbullah","given":"Nurul Fadzlin"},{"family":"Zabidi","given":"Suriza Ahmad"}],"citation-key":"haddadSystematicReviewAIBlockchain2022","container-title":"IEEE ACCESS","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3201878","ISSN":"2169-3536","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"page":"94583-94615","title":"Systematic Review on AI-Blockchain Based E-Healthcare Records Management Systems","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},

Although many technical solutions have been proposed to solve the compatibility issues between blockchain and the GDPR, unresolved challenges remain. This study presents the gaps between the blockchain and the GDPR and explores solutions to bridge the gap. We review 91 previously published articles using a systematic literature review methodology. Then, we answer the following research questions: 1) Which solutions have been explored to allow the blockchain to comply with the GDPR? 2) What are the research gaps in the blockchain compliance field? Finally, we present five research gaps in this field: 1) development of a consent ontology model; 2) development of a methodology for monitoring fairness in the blockchain; 3) resolution of the contradiction between auditing and obfuscation; 4) development of a methodology for tracking controllers in the blockchain; and 5) integration of the different-purposed technical solutions without conflicts. Our research can raise the compatibility level of the blockchain and GDPR and guide the company adopting a blockchain to comply with the GDPR.

  {"id":"hassijaDistributedFrameworkEnergy2020","abstract":"Use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is rapidly increasing in various domains such as disaster management, delivery of goods, surveillance, military, etc. Significant issues in the expansion of UAV-based applications are the security of (IoT to UAV) communication, and the limited flight time of the UAVs and IoT devices considering the limited battery power. Standalone UAVs are not capable of accomplishing several tasks, and therefore swarm of UAVs is being explored. Security issues in the swarm of UAVs do not allow the applications to leverage the full benefits that one can offer. Several recent studies have proposed the use of a distributed network of UAVs to upgrade the level of security in the swarm of UAVs. In this paper, a framework for secure and reliable energy trading among UAVs and charging stations is presented. Advanced blockchain, based on the tangle data structure is used to create a distributed network of UAVs and charging stations. The proposed model allows the UAVs to buy energy from the charging station in exchange for tokens. If the UAV does not have sufficient tokens to buy the energy, then the model allows the UAV to borrow tokens from the charging station. The borrowed tokens can be repaid back to the charging station with interest or late fees. A game-theoretic model is used for deciding the buying strategy of energy for UAVs. Numerical analysis shows that the proposed model helps in providing increased utility for the swarm of UAVs and charging stations in a secure and cost-optimal way as compared to the conventional schemes. The results can eventually be applied to IoT devices that constantly need energy to perform under ideal conditions.","author":[{"family":"Hassija","given":"Vikas"},{"family":"Chamola","given":"Vinay"},{"family":"Krishna","given":"Dara Nanda Gopala"},{"family":"Guizani","given":"Mohsen"}],"citation-key":"hassijaDistributedFrameworkEnergy2020","container-title":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY","DOI":"10.1109/TVT.2020.2977036","ISSN":"0018-9545","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,5]]},"page":"5391-5402","title":"A Distributed Framework for Energy Trading Between UAVs and Charging Stations for Critical Applications","type":"article-journal","volume":"69"},
  {"id":"hassijaFastReliableSecure2021","abstract":"Drone security is currently a major topic of discussion among researchers and industrialists. Although there are multiple applications of drones, if the security challenges are not anticipated and required architectural changes are not made, the upcoming drone applications will not be able to serve their actual purpose. Therefore, in this paper, we present a detailed review of the security-critical drone applications, and security-related challenges in drone communication such as DoS attacks, Man-in-the-middle attacks, De-Authentication attacks, and so on. Furthermore, as part of solution architectures, the use of Blockchain, Software Defined Networks (SDN), Machine Learning, and Fog/Edge computing are discussed as these are the most emerging technologies. Drones are highly resource-constrained devices and therefore it is not possible to deploy heavy security algorithms on board. Blockchain can be used to cryptographically store all the data that is sent to/from the drones, thereby saving it from tampering and eavesdropping. Various ML algorithms can be used to detect malicious drones in the network and to detect safe routes. Additionally, the SDN technology can be used to make the drone network reliable by allowing the controller to keep a close check on data traffic, and fog computing can be used to keep the computation capabilities closer to the drones without overloading them.","author":[{"family":"Hassija","given":"Vikas"},{"family":"Chamola","given":"Vinay"},{"family":"Agrawal","given":"Adhar"},{"family":"Goyal","given":"Adit"},{"family":"Luong","given":"Nguyen Cong"},{"family":"Niyato","given":"Dusit"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Fei Richard"},{"family":"Guizani","given":"Mohsen"}],"citation-key":"hassijaFastReliableSecure2021","container-title":"IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS AND TUTORIALS","DOI":"10.1109/COMST.2021.3097916","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"page":"2802-2832","title":"Fast, Reliable, and Secure Drone Communication: A Comprehensive Survey","type":"article-journal","volume":"23"},
  {"id":"hassijaSurveySupplyChain2021","abstract":"The rapid improvement in the global connectivity standards has escalated the level of trade taking place among different parties. Advanced communication standards are allowing the trade of all types of commodities and services. Furthermore, the goods and services developed in a particular region are transcending boundaries to enter into foreign markets. Supply chains play an essential role in the trade of these goods. To be able to realize a connected world with no boundary restrictions in terms of goods and services, it is imperative to keep the associated supply chains transparent, secure, and trustworthy. Therefore, some fundamental changes in the current supply chain architecture are essential to achieve a secure trade environment. This article discusses the supply chain's security-critical application areas and presents a detailed survey of the security issues in the existing supply chain architecture. Various emerging technologies, such as blockchain, machine learning (ML), and physically unclonable functions (PUFs) as solutions to the vulnerabilities in the existing infrastructure of the supply chain have also been discussed. Recent studies reviewed in this work reveal a growing sentiment in the industry toward new and emerging technologies, such as Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and ML. While many organizations have already adopted IoT applications and artificial intelligence systems in their businesses, widespread adoption of blockchain remains distant. It has also been found that over the past decade, PUF-based authentication systems have gained much ground. However, a proper reference model for their implementation in complex supply chains is still missing.","author":[{"family":"Hassija","given":"Vikas"},{"family":"Chamola","given":"Vinay"},{"family":"Gupta","given":"Vatsal"},{"family":"Jain","given":"Sarthak"},{"family":"Guizani","given":"Nadra"}],"citation-key":"hassijaSurveySupplyChain2021","container-title":"IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL","DOI":"10.1109/JIOT.2020.3025775","ISSN":"2327-4662","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,15]]},"page":"6222-6246","title":"A Survey on Supply Chain Security: Application Areas, Security Threats, and Solution Architectures","type":"article-journal","volume":"8"},

IoT affords the potential to couple machine-to-machine intercommunication and real-time information-gathering within the industry domain. Hence, the enactment of IoT in the industry magnifies effective optimization, authority, and data-driven judgment. However, this field undergoes several interoperable issues, including large numbers of heterogeneous IoT gadgets, tools, software, sensing, and processing components, joining through the Internet, despite the deficiency of communication protocols and standards. Recently, various interoperable protocols, platforms, standards, and technologies are enhanced and altered according to the specifications of the applicability in industrial applications. However, there are no recent survey papers that primarily examine various interoperability issues that Industrial IoT (IIoT) faces. In this review, we investigate the conventional and recent developments of relevant state-of-the-art IIoT technologies, frameworks, and solutions for facilitating interoperability between different IIoT components. We also discuss several interoperable IIoT standards, protocols, and models for digitizing the industrial revolution.

  {"id":"heBlockchainEnabledTechniquesEnergy2022","abstract":"The Internet of Things (IoT) technology involved in applications such as microgrids, new energy vehicles, smart charging piles, smart home and other intelligent equipment with function of energy prosumer is called the Energy Internet of Things (EIoT), which aims to create a better environment to manage energy data as well as to enhance efficiency of the information exchange. EIoT has become a vital role in the energy field. However, a challenge facing the widespread adoption of EIoT is the issue of data leakage caused by nontransparent and untrusted energy market. Blockchain technology has the characteristics of decentralization, traceability, and no need for a third-party trust mechanism. It can be synergistic and complementary with EIoT to improve its security. This paper aims to study the integration of blockchain and EIoT. We present the typical applications of blockchain in the EIoT field from the three technical dimensions of smart contract, consensus protocol, and cross-chain communication. In addition, we summarize the performance evaluation methods of the blockchain-based EIoT scheme. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges associated with blockchain technology in the field of EIoT, and also presented the state-of-the-art research works addressing these challenges.","author":[{"family":"He","given":"Qiulin"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Mingzhe"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jianping"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Runxi"}],"citation-key":"heBlockchainEnabledTechniquesEnergy2022","collection-title":"Communications in Computer and Information Science","container-title":"BLOCKCHAIN AND TRUSTWORTHY SYSTEMS, BLOCKSYS 2022","DOI":"10.1007/978-981-19-8043-5_10","editor":[{"family":"Svetinovic","given":"D"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Y"},{"family":"Luo","given":"X"},{"family":"Huang","given":"X"},{"family":"Chen","given":"X"}],"ISBN":"978-981-19804-2-8 978-981-19804-3-5","ISSN":"1865-0929","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"page":"134-146","title":"Blockchain-Enabled Techniques for Energy Internet of Things: A Review","type":"paper-conference","volume":"1679"},

  {"id":"heidingResearchCommunitiesCyber2023","abstract":"Ethical hacking and vulnerability assessments are gaining rapid momentum as academic fields of study. Still, it is sometimes unclear what research areas are included in the categories and how they fit into the traditional academic framework. Previous studies have reviewed literature in the field, but the attempts use manual analysis and thus fail to provide a comprehensive view of the domain. To better understand how the area is treated within academia, 537,629 related articles from the Scopus database were analyzed. A Python script was used for data mining as well as analysis of the data, and 23,459 articles were included in the final synthesis. The publication dates of the articles ranged from 1975 to 2022. They were authored by 53,495 authors and produced an aggregated total of 836,956 citations. Fifteen research communities were detected using the Louvain community detection algorithm: (smart grids, attack graphs, security testing, software vulnerabilities, Internet of Things (IoT), network vulnerability, vulnerability analysis, Android, cascading failures, authentication, Software-Defined Networking (SDN), spoofing attacks, malware, trust models, and red teaming). In addition, each community had several individual subcommunities, constituting a total of 126. From the trends of the analyzed studies, it is clear that research interest in ethical hacking and vulnerability assessment is increasing.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

For storage optimisation of data-centric blockchains, MLDC introduces a hierarchical storage class (SC), in which every node is assigned to an SC with its own Access Frequency (AF) threshold based on node availability. To reduce the number of replications shared among participant nodes, each node in a SC continues to remove unaccessed data from local storage based on a threshold time determined by the AF threshold of the SC, while maintaining all block hashes for consistency. Eventually, all nodes in MLDC store the most frequently accessed data in their local storage, so MLDC effectively reduces the storage and query costs while minimising network overhead. We also analyse the security of MLDC and quantitatively evaluate its performance for both the uniform access and exponentially decaying access patterns. The evaluation was carried out on a representative blockchain simulator with 15 storage nodes. Our results from 11 hours of experiments producing 6667 blocks and 39997 transactions show good performance for MLDC. The results of the experimentation for the exponentially decaying assess pattern show that MLDC can reduce the total storage cost by 83% compared to conventional blockchain systems, while maintaining blockchain consistency and data availability with a slight increase in network overhead and query cost.","author":[{"family":"Heo","given":"Jun Wook"},{"family":"Ramachandran","given":"Gowri Sankar"},{"family":"Dorri","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Jurdak","given":"Raja"}],"citation-key":"heoBlockchainStorageOptimisation2022","container-title":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORK AND SERVICE MANAGEMENT","DOI":"10.1109/TNSM.2022.3224735","ISSN":"1932-4537","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,12]]},"page":"3724-3736","title":"Blockchain Storage Optimisation With Multi-Level Distributed Caching","type":"article-journal","volume":"19"},

The information extracted is then analyzed through machine learning algorithms for useful insights.FindingsThe research results indicate that the recovery of the global supply chain in China could potentially drive the global supply chain to return to normalcy. In addition, researchers and policymakers should prioritize two aspects: (1) Ease of cross-border trade and logistics. Digitization of the supply chain and applying breakthrough technologies like blockchain and IoT are needed more than ever before. (2) Supply chain resilience. The high dependency of the global supply chain on China sounds like an alarm of supply chain resilience. It calls for a framework to increase global supply chain resilience that enables quick recovery from disruptions in the long term.Originality/valueDiffering from other studies taking the natural language processing (NLP) approach, this research uses Internet articles as the data source.

Traditional IdM systems are highly dependent on central authorities; any failure can potentially compromise the entire system. To eliminate the drawback of central authorities and evolve IdM systems to meet increasingly stringent security requirements, the Decentralized Identification approach has been proposed. This approach often relies on blockchain technology to provide a secure and tamper-proof method of managing and verifying identities. Therefore, this article investigates the capabilities of blockchain-based decentralized identification for the IoT domain, with an emphasis on the heterogeneity of online devices. It describes a number of features and specifications of decentralized identification with a specific focus on Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), a model in which entities own their identities.

At the same time, the complexity of interplay among stakeholders has grown in size, granularity, and variation of trust. In this paper, we consider an IIoT resource market with heterogeneous buyers such as manufacturer owners. The buyers interact with the resource supplier dynamically with specific resource demands. This work introduces a broker between the supplier and the buyers, equipped with Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) providing a service for market security and trustworthiness. We first model the DLT-assisted IIoT market analytically to determine an offline solution and understand the selfish interactions among different entities (buyers, supplier, broker). Considering the non-cooperative heterogeneous buyers in the dynamic market, we then follow an independent learners framework to determine an online solution. In particular, the decision-making procedures of buyers are modeled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process which is solved using independent Q-learning. We evaluate both the offline and online solutions with analytical simulations, and the results show that the proposed approaches successfully maximize players' satisfaction. The results further demonstrate that independent Q-learners achieve equilibrium in a dynamic market even without the availability of complete information and communication, and reach a better solution compared to that of centralized Q-learning.","author":[{"family":"Hu","given":"Jiejun"},{"family":"Reed","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Thomos","given":"Nikolaos"},{"family":"Al-Naday","given":"Mays F.

  {"id":"iftikharPrivacyPreservationResourceConstrained2021","abstract":"With opportunities brought by Internet of Things (IoT), it is quite a challenge to assure privacy preservation when a huge number of resource-constrained distributed devices is involved. Blockchain has become popular for its benefits, including decentralization, persistence, immutability, auditability and consensus. With the implementation of blockchain in IoT, the benefits provided by blockchain can be derived in order to make IoT more efficient and maintain trust. In this paper, we discuss some applications of IoT in different fields and privacy-related issues faced by IoT in resource-constrained devices. We discuss some applications of blockchain in vast majority of areas, and the opportunities it brings to resolve IoT privacy limitations. We, then, survey different researches based on the implementation of blockchain in IoT. The goal of this paper is to survey recent researches based on the implementation of blockchain in IoT for privacy preservation. After analyzing the recent solutions, we see that the blockchain is an optimal way for preventing identity disclosure, monitoring, and providing tracking in IoT.","author":[{"family":"Iftikhar","given":"Zainab"},{"family":"Javed","given":"Yasir"},{"family":"Zaidi","given":"Syed Yawar Abbas"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Munam Ali"},{"family":"Khan","given":"Zafar Iqbal"},{"family":"Mussadiq","given":"Shafaq"},{"family":"Abbasi","given":"Kamran"}],"citation-key":"iftikharPrivacyPreservationResourceConstrained2021","container-title":"ELECTRONICS","DOI":"10.3390/electronics10141732","issue":"14","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,7]]},"title":"Privacy Preservation in Resource-Constrained IoT Devices Using Blockchain-A Survey","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"illyMLBasedIDPSEnhancement2022","abstract":"The Internet of Things (IoT) networks are obstructed by security vulnerabilities that hackers can leverage to operate intrusions in many environments, such as smart homes, smart factories, and smart healthcare systems. To overcome this obstruction, researchers have come up with different intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPSs). Out of all the implemented technologies, Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as the most promising approach. Therefore, to improve the detection accuracy, most ML-based intrusion detection solutions focus only on investigating appropriate ML algorithms. Yet, the limitations in terms of detection accuracy in various attacks are often caused by lack of appropriate detection features. Moreover, the majority of the previous works lack intrusion prevention mechanisms and deployment architectures. Thus, in this research, we study the properties of different smart home security attacks and the quality of the features that can be brought out and employed in ML algorithms to detect each of these attacks efficiently. Furthermore, this research proposes effective intrusion prevention mechanisms and a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) based deployment architecture of the IDPSs within home networks. Experimental evaluations of the proposed solution are provided using different feature sets and various ML models. The contributions and advancements discussed in this paper will upgrade future research and engineering works on IDPSs for IoT.","author":[{"family":"Illy","given":"Poulmanogo"},{"family":"Kaddoum","given":"Georges"},{"family":"Kaur","given":"Kuljeet"},{"family":"Garg","given":"Sahil"}],"citation-key":"illyMLBasedIDPSEnhancement2022","container-title":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORK AND SERVICE MANAGEMENT","DOI":"10.1109/TNSM.2022.3141942","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,6]]},"page":"772-783","title":"ML-Based IDPS Enhancement With Complementary Features for Home IoT Networks","type":"article-journal","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"imranTopicalReviewMachine2021","abstract":"In recent years, rapid development has been made to the Internet of Things communication technologies, infrastructure, and physical resources management. These developments and research trends address challenges such as heterogeneous communication, quality of service requirements, unpredictable network conditions, and a massive influx of data. One major contribution to the research world is in the form of software-defined networking applications, which aim to deploy rule-based management to control and add intelligence to the network using high-level policies to have integral control of the network without knowing issues related to low-level configurations. Machine learning techniques coupled with software-defined networking can make the networking decision more intelligent and robust. The Internet of Things application has recently adopted virtualization of resources and network control with software-defined networking policies to make the traffic more controlled and maintainable. However, the requirements of software-defined networking and the Internet of Things must be aligned to make the adaptations possible. This paper aims to discuss the possible ways to make software-defined networking enabled Internet of Things application and discusses the challenges solved using the Internet of Things leveraging the software-defined network. We provide a topical survey of the application and impact of software-defined networking on the Internet of things networks. We also study the impact of machine learning techniques applied to software-defined networking and its application perspective. The study is carried out from the different perspectives of software-based Internet of Things networks, including wide-area networks, edge networks, and access networks. Machine learning techniques are presented from the perspective of network resources management, security, classification of traffic, quality of experience, and quality of service prediction. Finally, we discuss challenges and issues in adopting machine learning and software-defined networking for the Internet of Things applications.","author":[{"literal":"Imran"},{"family":"Ghaffar","given":"Zeba"},{"family":"Alshahrani","given":"Abdullah"},{"family":"Fayaz","given":"Muhammad"},{"family":"Alghamdi","given":"Ahmed Mohammed"},{"family":"Gwak","given":"Jeonghwan"}],"citation-key":"imranTopicalReviewMachine2021","container-title":"ELECTRONICS","DOI":"10.3390/electronics10080880","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4]]},"title":"A Topical Review on Machine Learning, Software Defined Networking, Internet of Things Applications: Research Limitations and Challenges","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},

Industries and academia have started to design 6G networks and propose the use of AI in its protocols and operations. Published papers on the topic discuss either the requirements of applications via a top-down approach or the network requirements in terms of agility, performance, and energy saving using a down-top perspective. In contrast, this paper adopts a holistic outlook, considering the applications, the middleware, the underlying technologies, and the 6G network systems towards an intelligent and integrated computing, communication, coordination, and decision-making ecosystem. In particular, we discuss the temporal evolution of the wireless network generations' development to capture the applications, middleware, and technological requirements that led to the development of the network generation systems from 1G to AI-enabled 6G and its employed self-learning models. We provide a taxonomy of the technology-enabled smart city applications' systems and present insights into those systems for the realization of a trustworthy and efficient smart city ecosystem.

  {"id":"ismailComparativeStudyMachine2021","abstract":"Wireless Sensor Network is a key technology for Internet of Things, but it is an example of energy-restricted networks. In such networks with a large number of deployed sensors with limited capabilities, security becomes a crucial concern which requires proper design of detection and mitigation techniques that address such challenge. Machine learning is one of the most efficient ways to design cyber-attacks detection systems for WSN. This paper presents a comparative study and performance analysis of different machine learning classification techniques for cyber-attacks detection in WSN. We investigate the performance of three recent boosting techniques, namely GBM, LightGBM, and Catboost. Their performances are compared to those of three commonly known machine learning methods, namely Gaussian NB, KNN, and RF. We apply both Pearson's correlation and mutual information as an ensemble feature selection and dimensionality reduction. Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool is utilized for hyperparameter tuning. We use the specialized dataset, WSN-DS, that contains numerous samples corresponding to four kinds of attacks: Grayhole, Blackhole, Flooding, and TDMA scheduling. The performance of the six models is investigated in terms of accuracy, probability of detection, probability of false alarm, probability of misdetection, memory usage, processing time, and average prediction time per sample.","author":[{"family":"Ismail","given":"Shereen"},{"family":"Khoei","given":"Tala Talaei"},{"family":"Marsh","given":"Ronald"},{"family":"Kaabouch","given":"Naima"}],"citation-key":"ismailComparativeStudyMachine2021","container-title":"2021 IEEE 12TH ANNUAL UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING, ELECTRONICS & MOBILE COMMUNICATION CONFERENCE (UEMCON)","DOI":"10.1109/UEMCON53757.2021.9666581","editor":[{"family":"Paul","given":"R."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"page":"313-318","title":"A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Models for Cyber-attacks Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks","type":"paper-conference"},

Many current solutions suffer from data fragmentation, lack of reliable provenance, and diverse protocol regulations across multiple distributions and processes. Amongst other solutions, Blockchain has emerged as a leading technology, since it provides secure traceability and control, immutability, and trust creation among stakeholders in a low cost IT solution. Although Blockchain is making a significant impact in many areas, there are many impediments to its widespread adoption in supply chains. This article is the first survey of its kind, with detailed analysis of the challenges and future directions in Blockchain-enabled supply chains. We review the existing digitalization of the supply chain including the role of GS1 standards and technologies. Current use cases and startups in the field of Blockchain-enabled supply chains are reviewed and presented in tabulated form. Technical and non-technical challenges in the adoption of Blockchain for supply chain applications are critically analyzed, along with the suitability of various consensus algorithms for applications in the supply chain. The tools and technologies in the Blockchain ecosystem are depicted and analyzed. Some key areas as future research directions are also identified which must be addressed to realize mass adoption of Blockchain-based in supply chain traceability.

  {"id":"jabbarBlockchainInternetVehicles2021","abstract":"As the Internet of Things (IoT) is evolving, one of its rapidly developing components is the transformation of standard Vehicle Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) into the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Due to the exceptional progress in computation and communication technologies, the IoV has attracted the attention of researchers and commercial companies. Nevertheless, the primary issue regarding the IoV, and in particular to Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), is establishing secure and instant payments andcommunications. To respond to this challenge, this work proposes a Blockchain-based solution for establishing secure payment and communication (PSEV) in order to study the use of Blockchain as middle-ware between different participants of intelligent transportation systems. The proposed framework employs Ethereum to develop a solution aimed at facilitating Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications and parking payments.

  {"id":"jahidConvergenceBlockchainIoT2023","abstract":"6G networks envisioned being the game changer in next generation wireless communication systems that will address the challenges of limited information speed escalated with the augmentation of billions of data applications encountered by the current fifth generation (5G) networks. Some key radical technologies in 6G together with existing 5G candidate schemes will guarantee the expected quality of experience (QoE) to attain ubiquitous wireless connectivity for the Internet of Everything (IoE) ranging from the telecom industry to digital smart industries. Blockchain technology (BCT) has gained significant attention due to undertake the decentralization, transparency, spectrum resource scarcity, inherent privacy and security, interoperability, confidentiality, and emerging smart applications domains including Industrial IoT (IIoT) and Industry 5.0 applications. The mismatch between the requirements of many data intensive disruptive IoT applications and 5G network capabilities steered the demand of decentralized BCT based 6G architecture. Inspired by these facts, this paper studies an extensive survey to draw a new direction of blockchain integration into 6G mobile networks, IoT technologies, and smart industries in terms of infrastructure sharing, computational loads, latency, bandwidth overhead, business model, sustainability goals, and edge intelligence focusing the potential merits and challenges. We highlighted the convergence of IoT in blockchain to enable intelligent distribution in future IIoT and the technical model of 6G networks to realize the successful deployment of BCT schemes. This paper pointed out the current intriguing challenges, canvassed the mitigation techniques, and plausible future research opportunities that may privilege the pursuit of this vision.","author":[{"family":"Jahid","given":"Abu"},{"family":"Alsharif","given":"Mohammed H."},{"family":"Hall","given":"Trevor J."}],"citation-key":"jahidConvergenceBlockchainIoT2023","container-title":"JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS","DOI":"10.1016/j.jnca.2023.103677","ISSN":"1084-8045","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,8]]},"title":"The convergence of blockchain, IoT and 6G: Potential, opportunities, challenges and research roadmap","type":"article-journal","volume":"217"},

  {"id":"jameelReinforcementLearningBlockchainEnabled2020","abstract":"Blockchain is emerging as a promising candidate for the uberization of Internet services. It is a decentralized, secure, and auditable solution for exchanging, and authenticating information via transactions, without the need of a trusted third party. Therefore, blockchain technology has recently been integrated with industrial Internet-of-things (IIoT) networks to help realize the fourth industrial revolution, Industry 4.0. Though blockchain-enabled IIoT networks may have the potential to support the services and demands of next-generation networks, the gap analysis presented in this work highlights some of the areas that need improvement. Based on these observations, the article then promotes the utility of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to address some of the major issues of blockchain-enabled IIoT networks such as block time minimization and transaction throughput enhancement. This is followed by a comprehensive case study where a Q-learning technique is used for minimizing the occurrence of forking events by reducing the transmission delays for a miner. Extensive simulations have been performed and the results have been obtained for the average transmission delay which relates to the forking events. The obtained results demonstrate that the Q-learning approach outperforms the greedy policy while having a reasonable level of complexity. To further develop the blockchain-enabled IIoT networks, some future research directions are also documented. While this article highlights the applications of RL techniques in blockchain-enabled IIoT networks, the provided insights and results could pave the way for rapid adoption of blockchain technology.","author":[{"family":"Jameel","given":"Furqan"},{"family":"Javaid","given":"Uzair"},{"family":"Khan","given":"Wali Ullah"},{"family":"Aman","given":"Muhammad Naveed"},{"family":"Pervaiz","given":"Haris"},{"family":"Jantti","given":"Riku"}],"citation-key":"jameelReinforcementLearningBlockchainEnabled2020","container-title":"SUSTAINABILITY","DOI":"10.3390/su12125161","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,6]]},"title":"Reinforcement Learning in Blockchain-Enabled IIoT Networks: A Survey of Recent Advances and Open Challenges","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},

This data is used by industries and developers to provide more efficient devices and services to users. Owner of the IoT device can generate revenue by selling IoT device data to interested consumers. However, on the other hand consumers do not trust the owner of IoT device for data trading and are not confident about the quality of data. Traditional systems for data trading have many limitations, such as they are centralized, lack reputation system, security and involve third party. Therefore in this paper, we have leveraged the IoT with blockchain technology to provide a trustful trading through automatic review system for monetizing IoT data. We have developed blockchain based review system for IoT data monetization using Ethereum smart contracts. All transactions are secure and payments are automated without any human intervention. Data quality is ensured to consumer through reviews and ratings about the data. Additionally, Ethereum blockchain system requires gas for every transaction. We have used 2 parameters: gas consumption, string input length and in terms of time and cost, and examined our model.","author":[{"family":"Javaid","given":"Atia"},{"family":"Zahid","given":"Maheen"},{"family":"Ali","given":"Ishtiaq"},{"family":"Khan","given":"Raja Jalees Ul Hussen"},{"family":"Noshad","given":"Zainib"},{"family":"Javaid","given":"Nadeem"}],"citation-key":"javaidReputationSystemIoT2020","collection-title":"Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems","container-title":"ADVANCES ON BROAD-BAND WIRELESS COMPUTING, COMMUNICATION AND APPLICATIONS","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-33506-9_16","editor":[{"family":"Barolli","given":"L"},{"family":"Hellinckx","given":"P"},{"family":"Enokido","given":"T"}],"ISBN":"978-3-030-33506-9 978-3-030-33505-2","ISSN":"2367-3370","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"page":"173-184","publisher":"IEEE","title":"Reputation System for IoT Data Monetization Using Blockchain","type":"paper-conference","volume":"97"},

Computation cost, communication overheads, and privacy issues are significant concerns for wide-scale ML adoption within STI. These issues can be addressed using Federated Learning (FL) and blockchain. FL can be used to address the issues of privacy preservation and handling big data generated in STI management and control. Blockchain is a distributed ledger that can store data while providing trust and integrity assurance. Blockchain can be a solution to data integrity and can add more security to the STI.

Particularly, industrial IoT (IIoT) is promoting a new round of industrial revolution. With more applications of IIoT, privacy protection issues are emerging. Especially, some common algorithms in IIoT technology, such as deep models, strongly rely on data collection, which leads to the risk of privacy disclosure. Recently, differential privacy has been used to protect user-terminal privacy in IIoT, so it is necessary to make in-depth research on this topic. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the opportunities, applications, and challenges of differential privacy in IIoT. We first review related papers on IIoT and privacy protection, respectively. Then, we focus on the metrics of industrial data privacy, and analyze the contradiction between data utilization for deep models and individual privacy protection. Several valuable problems are summarized and new research ideas are put forward. In conclusion, this survey is dedicated to complete comprehensive summary and lay foundation for the follow-up research on industrial differential privacy.","author":[{"family":"Jiang","given":"Bin"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jianqiang"},{"family":"Yue","given":"Guanghui"},{"family":"Song","given":"Houbing"}],"citation-key":"jiangDifferentialPrivacyIndustrial2021","container-title":"IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL","DOI":"10.1109/JIOT.2021.3057419","ISSN":"2327-4662","issue":"13","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,1]]},"page":"10430-10451","title":"Differential Privacy for Industrial Internet of Things: Opportunities, Applications, and Challenges","type":"article-journal","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"joshiAdoptionBlockchainTechnology2022","abstract":"Compared to centralized and decentralized models, distributed models have the potential to dramatically expand the scalability of existing IoT and Industry 4.0 solutions while maintaining participant organizations' security and privacy. This is partly because participating firms are not required to rely on or trust other services or third parties to manage the data they gather and transfer, out of concern that these parties could misuse the data or, in the worst-case scenario, share it with mass surveillance programs. However, until blockchain technology (BCT) demonstrates its viability as a means of developing security solutions in decentralized, collaborative, and trustless environments, the vast majority of these use cases will struggle to meet the requirements for integrity, immutability, traceability, and notarization. By utilizing BCT, it is possible to eliminate intermediaries, enabling individuals and devices to manage their data independently of third parties and most significantly to achieve a high level of traceability with information flow harmony. This technology enables transaction, transparency, and traceability by enabling for the interchange of historical data. The fundamentals of blockchain are examined in this research paper, along with an investigation of its operation and a discussion of some of its most fundamental aspects and concepts. A concise overview of smart contracts enables us to completely reimagine how network members create and automate transactions. Finally, several IoT and Industry 4.0 application possibilities that leverage blockchain are investigated, as is the blockchain's future trajectory.","author":[{"family":"Joshi","given":"Shubham"},{"family":"Pise","given":"Anil Audumbar"},{"family":"Shrivastava","given":"Manish"},{"family":"Revathy","given":"C."},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Harish"},{"family":"Alsetoohy","given":"Omar"},{"family":"Akwafo","given":"Reynah"}],"citation-key":"joshiAdoptionBlockchainTechnology2022","container-title":"WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING","DOI":"10.1155/2022/4079781","ISSN":"1530-8669","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,22]]},"title":"Adoption of Blockchain Technology for Privacy and Security in the Context of Industry 4.0","type":"article-journal","volume":"2022"},

  {"id":"junaidRecentAdvancementsEmerging2022","abstract":"In recent times, the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and Blockchain technologies have quickly gained pace as a new study niche in numerous collegiate and industrial sectors, notably in the healthcare sector. Recent advancements in healthcare delivery have given many patients access to advanced personalized healthcare, which has improved their well-being. The subsequent phase in healthcare is to seamlessly consolidate these emerging technologies such as IoT-assisted wearable sensor devices, AI, and Blockchain collectively. Surprisingly, owing to the rapid use of smart wearable sensors, IoT and AI-enabled technology are shifting healthcare from a conventional hub-based system to a more personalized healthcare management system (HMS). However, implementing smart sensors, advanced IoT, AI, and Blockchain technologies synchronously in HMS remains a significant challenge. Prominent and reoccurring issues such as scarcity of cost-effective and accurate smart medical sensors, unstandardized IoT system architectures, heterogeneity of connected wearable devices, the multidimensionality of data generated, and high demand for interoperability are vivid problems affecting the advancement of HMS. Hence, this survey paper presents a detailed evaluation of the application of these emerging technologies (Smart Sensor, IoT, AI, Blockchain) in HMS to better understand the progress thus far. Specifically, current studies and findings on the deployment of these emerging technologies in healthcare are investigated, as well as key enabling factors, noteworthy use cases, and successful deployments. This survey also examined essential issues that are frequently encountered by IoT-assisted wearable sensor systems, AI, and Blockchain, as well as the critical concerns that must be addressed to enhance the application of these emerging technologies in the HMS.","author":[{"family":"Junaid","given":"Sahalu Balarabe"},{"family":"Imam","given":"Abdullahi Abubakar"},{"family":"Balogun","given":"Abdullateef Oluwagbemiga"},{"family":"De Silva","given":"Liyanage Chandratilak"},{"family":"Surakat","given":"Yusuf Alhaji"},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Ganesh"},{"family":"Abdulkarim","given":"Muhammad"},{"family":"Shuaibu","given":"Aliyu Nuhu"},{"family":"Garba","given":"Aliyu"},{"family":"Sahalu","given":"Yusra"},{"family":"Mohammed","given":"Abdullahi"},{"family":"Mohammed","given":"Tanko Yahaya"},{"family":"Abdulkadir","given":"Bashir Abubakar"},{"family":"Abba","given":"Abdallah Alkali"},{"family":"Kakumi","given":"Nana Aliyu Iliyasu"},{"family":"Mahamad","given":"Saipunidzam"}],"citation-key":"junaidRecentAdvancementsEmerging2022","container-title":"HEALTHCARE","DOI":"10.3390/healthcare10101940","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,10]]},"title":"Recent Advancements in Emerging Technologies for Healthcare Management Systems: A Survey","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"kalapaakingSmartPolicyControl2023","abstract":"The widespread adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in smart cities, intelligent healthcare systems, and various real-world applications have resulted in the generation of vast amounts of data, often analyzed using different Machine Learning (ML) models. Federated learning (FL) has been acknowledged as a privacy-preserving machine learning technology, where multiple parties cooperatively train ML models without exchanging raw data. However, the current FL architecture does not allow for an audit of the training process due to the various data-protection policies implemented by each FL participant. Furthermore, there is no global model verifiability available in the current architecture. This paper proposes a smart contract-based policy control for securing the Federated Learning (FL) management system. First, we develop and deploy a smart contract-based local training policy control on the FL participants' side. This policy control is used to verify the training process, ensuring that the evaluation process follows the same rules for all FL participants. We then enforce a smart contract-based aggregation policy to manage the global model aggregation process. Upon completion, the aggregated model and policy are stored on blockchain-based storage. Subsequently, we distribute the aggregated global model and the smart contract to all FL participants. Our proposed method uses smart policy control to manage access and verify the integrity of machine learning models.

  {"id":"kamarudeenAssessmentDubaiMetro2020","abstract":"Metro service operations have become challenging in modern urban environments due to the dynamics of population, service levels, accuracy and other operational issues. This research applies the supply chain operations reference (SCOR) model combined with the ARENA model simulation to examine the service performance in the Dubai Metro. The proposed approach takes into consideration the real-time flows of metro service operations and simulates the passengers' service time in selected terminals. The researchers measure the actual time spent by passengers and estimate various possible scenarios as outcome. The researchers assessed the average time spent in the system and the performance improvement as a visualized outcome, with suggestions for improvements, such as: onboard card recharge, automatic checkout using radio-frequency identification (RFID) systems, integration of systems using the Internet of things (IOT) and blockchain and a dedicated lane system. The proposed recommendations have the potential to contribute to service performance improvement of the metro rail, as Dubai plans for its operational expansion process towards Expo 2020. This research methodology and these results can be extended to metro service operations of other urban centres, to better understand passengers' behaviour in the future. In view of this, the research contributes to both the theory and practice of travel behaviour in the metro transportation service.","author":[{"family":"Kamarudeen","given":"Niyazudeen"},{"family":"Sundarakani","given":"Balan"},{"family":"Manikas","given":"Ioannis"}],"citation-key":"kamarudeenAssessmentDubaiMetro2020","container-title":"FIIB BUSINESS REVIEW","DOI":"10.1177/2319714520925749","ISSN":"2319-7145","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,9]]},"page":"167-180","title":"An Assessment of the Dubai Metro Service's Performance Using SCOR Model and ARENA Simulation","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"kareemEffectiveFeatureSelection2022","abstract":"The increasing use of Internet of Things (IoT) applications in various aspects of our lives has created a huge amount of data. IoT applications often require the presence of many technologies such as cloud computing and fog computing, which have led to serious challenges to security. As a result of the use of these technologies, cyberattacks are also on the rise because current security methods are ineffective. Several artiﬁcial intelligence (AI)-based security solutions have been presented in recent years, including intrusion detection systems (IDS). Feature selection (FS) approaches are required for the development of intelligent analytic tools that need data pretreatment and machinelearning algorithm-performance enhancement. By reducing the number of selected features, FS aims to improve classiﬁcation accuracy. This article presents a new FS method through boosting the performance of Gorilla Troops Optimizer (GTO) based on the algorithm for bird swarms (BSA). This BSA is used to boost performance exploitation of GTO in the newly developed GTO-BSA because it has a strong ability to ﬁnd feasible regions with optimal solutions. As a result, the quality of the ﬁnal output will increase, improving convergence. GTO-BSA’s performance was evaluated using a variety of performance measures on four IoT-IDS datasets: NSL-KDD, CICIDS-2017, UNSW-NB15 and BoT-IoT. The results were compared to those of the original GTO, BSA, and several state-of-the-art techniques in the literature. According to the ﬁndings of the experiments, GTO-BSA had a better convergence rate and higher-quality solutions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Kareem","given":"Saif S."},{"family":"Mostafa","given":"Reham R."},{"family":"Hashim","given":"Fatma A."},{"family":"El-Bakry","given":"Hazem M."}],"citation-key":"kareemEffectiveFeatureSelection2022","container-title":"Sensors","container-title-short":"Sensors","DOI":"10.3390/s22041396","ISSN":"1424-8220","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,11]]},"language":"en","page":"1396","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"An Effective Feature Selection Model Using Hybrid Metaheuristic Algorithms for IoT Intrusion Detection","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/4/1396","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"khanArtificialIntelligenceEnabled2023","abstract":"Demand Response (DR) has gained popularity in recent years as a practical strategy to increase the sustainability of energy systems while reducing associated costs. Despite this, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), have recently developed as critical technologies for demand-side management and response due to the high complexity of tasks associated with DR, as well as huge amount of data management to take decisions very near to real time implications. Selecting the best group of users to respond, learning their attitude toward consumptions and their priorities, price optimization, monitoring and control of devices, learning to engage more and more consumers in the DR schemes, and learning how to remunerate them fairly and economically are all problems that can be tackled with the help of AI techniques. This study presents an overview of AI approaches used for DR applications. Both the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithm(s) are employed while discussing commercial efforts (from both new and existing businesses) and large-scale innovation projects that have applied AI technologies for energy DR. Different kind of DR programs implemented in different countries are also discussed. Moreover, it also discusses the application of blockchain for DR schemes in smart grid paradigm. Discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the evaluated AI methods for various DR tasks, as well as suggestions for further study, round out the work.","author":[{"family":"Khan","given":"Muhammad Adnan"},{"family":"Saleh","given":"Ahmed Mohammed"},{"family":"Waseem","given":"Muhammad"},{"family":"Sajjad","given":"Intisar Ali"}],"citation-key":"khanArtificialIntelligenceEnabled2023","container-title":"IEEE ACCESS","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3231444","ISSN":"2169-3536","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023]]},"page":"1477-1505","title":"Artificial Intelligence Enabled Demand Response: Prospects and Challenges in Smart Grid Environment","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"khanDataSecurityHealthcare2023","abstract":"The industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has gained more attention because of the self-governing nature of system configuration with interoperable application connectivity. In the E-healthcare environment, it cooperates with medical sensors to capture, examine, analyze, preserve, and document day-to-day transactions of patients in real-time. The integration of E-healthcare and IIoT provides an analytical platform to handle a large amount of data with a low cost of cloud-enabling scalable storage. Throughout the transformation, patients' personal information is at risk while exchanging records over centralized server-based systems. Thus, the rate of node connectivity, failure of parallel data sharing, and deliverance-related issues increase. In this article, we present solutions in three folds. First, the article proposes a novel and secure architecture for E-healthcare data security using a blockchain-distributed ledger technology named BHIIoT. Second, the transformation in the lifecycle of medical wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for data management and optimization with a distributed layered hierarchy is developed, which enhances the network resources and increases trust in the blockchain-enabled peer-to-peer (P2P) environment. Third, the proposed BHIIoT uses the NuCypher threshold re-encryption mechanism for data encryption and protects shared resources in the form of blocks preserved in a blockchain immutable storage. For instance, chain codes are deployed to automate authentication, logging, index information deliverance, and trace transactions to resist illegal activities in the E-healthcare distributed application. The customized lightweight blockchain multi-proof-of-work (PoW) and multi-proof-of-stake (PoS) are designed with a digital signature for improving the consumption of resources and reducing the load of storage while the transaction process of E-healthcare IIoT is scheduled.","author":[{"family":"Khan","given":"Abdullah Ayub"},{"family":"Bourouis","given":"Sami"},{"family":"Kamruzzaman","given":"M.

  {"id":"khanSECURITYCHALLENGESFOG2020","abstract":"As the IoT is moving out of its early stages, it is emerging as an area of future internet. The evolving communication paradigm among cloud servers, Fog nodes and IoT devices are establishing a multilevel communication infrastructure. Fog provides a platform for IoT along with other services like networking, storage and computing. With the tremendous expansion of IoT, security threats also arise. These security hazards cannot be addressed by mere dependence on cloud model. In this paper we present an overview of security landscape of Fog computing, challenges, and, existing solutions. We outline major authentication issues in IoT, map their existing solutions and further tabulate Fog and IoT security loopholes. Furthermore this paper presents Blockchain, a decentralized distributed technology as one of the solutions for authentication issues in IoT. We tried to discuss the strength of Blockchain technology, work done in this field, its adoption in COVID-19 fight and tabulate various challenges in Blockchain technology. At last we present the Cell Tree architecture as another solution to address some of the security issues in IoT, outlined its advantages over Blockchain technology and tabulated some future course to stir some attempts in this area.","author":[{"family":"Khan","given":"Neelam Saleem"},{"family":"Chishti","given":"Mohammad Ahsan"}],"citation-key":"khanSECURITYCHALLENGESFOG2020","container-title":"SCALABLE COMPUTING-PRACTICE AND EXPERIENCE","DOI":"10.12694/scpe.v21i3.1782","ISSN":"1895-1767","issue":"3, SI","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,9]]},"page":"515-541","title":"SECURITY CHALLENGES IN FOG AND IOT, BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY AND CELL TREE SOLUTIONS: A REVIEW","type":"article-journal","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"khaterClassifierPerformanceEvaluation2021","abstract":"In this article, a Host-Based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) using a Modified Vector Space Representation (MVSR) N-gram and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model for securing the Internet of Things (IoT), based on lightweight techniques and using Fog Computing devices, is proposed. The Australian Defence Force Academy Linux Dataset (ADFA-LD), which contains exploits and attacks on various applications, is employed for the analysis. The proposed method is divided into the feature extraction stage, the feature selection stage, and classification modeling. To maintain the lightweight criteria, the feature extraction stage considers a combination of 1-gram and 2-gram for the system call encoding. In addition, a Sparse Matrix is used to reduce the space by keeping only the weight of the features that appear in the trace, thus ignoring the zero weights. Subsequently, Linear Correlation Coefficient (LCC) is utilized to compensate for any missing N-gram in the test data. In the feature selection stage, the Mutual Information (MI) method and Principle Component Analysis (PCA) are utilized and then compared to reduce the number of input features. Following the feature selection stage, the modeling and performance evaluation of various Machine Learning classifiers are conducted using a Raspberry Pi IoT device. Further analysis of the effect of MLP parameters, such as the number of nodes, number of features, activation, solver, and regularization parameters, is also conducted. From the simulation, it can be seen that different parameters affect the accuracy and lightweight evaluation. By using a single hidden layer and four nodes, the proposed method with MI can achieve 96% accuracy, 97% recall, 96% F1-Measure, 5% False Positive Rate (FPR), highest curve of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), and 96% Area Under the Curve (AUC). It also achieved low CPU time usage of 4.404 (ms) milliseconds and low energy consumption of 8.809 (mj) millijoules.","author":[{"family":"Khater","given":"Belal Sudqi"},{"family":"Wahab","given":"Ainuddin Wahid Abdul"},{"family":"Idris","given":"Mohd Yamani Idna"},{"family":"Hussain","given":"Mohammed Abdulla"},{"family":"Ibrahim","given":"Ashraf Ahmed"},{"family":"Amin","given":"Mohammad Arif"},{"family":"Shehadeh","given":"Hisham A."}],"citation-key":"khaterClassifierPerformanceEvaluation2021","container-title":"ELECTRONICS","DOI":"10.3390/electronics10141633","issue":"14","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,7]]},"title":"Classifier Performance Evaluation for Lightweight IDS Using Fog Computing in IoT Security","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"khawajaBlockchainTechnologyEnabler2023","abstract":"Smart cities driven by modern technologies are the need of the day to alleviate the urbanisation challenges and improve the overall experience of the citizens. As the role of data-sharing to facilitate systems integration across city sectors for developing smart cities has grown ever so profoundly, there is a need for decentralisation, transparency, and openness in terms of integration of city sectors to have efficient data diffusion among them. This is extremely important as the requirements of smart sustainable cities are open data sharing to allow service providers to better serve the citizens. Blockchain technology offers these characteristics with the extremely important added advantage of maintaining data security via an immutable record. However, the notion of the use of Blockchain for smart sustainable cities is still in the early years and requires extensive efforts to research and test it. In this research, a state-of-the-art review is conducted to explore the usefulness of Blockchain technology in smart sustainable city development with a specific focus on cross-sectoral systems integration, highlighting the gaps in the existing body of knowledge. This leads to the proposal of a novel framework for the use of Blockchain for smart sustainable cities, linking together service providers and citizens.","author":[{"family":"Khawaja","given":"Sarmad"},{"family":"Javidroozi","given":"Vahid"}],"citation-key":"khawajaBlockchainTechnologyEnabler2023","container-title":"IET SMART CITIES","DOI":"10.1049/smc2.12059","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,9]]},"page":"151-172","title":"Blockchain technology as an enabler for cross-sectoral systems integration for developing smart sustainable cities","type":"article-journal","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"koroniotisNewIntelligentSatellite2022","abstract":"By combining the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), new augmentations and enhancements are realized, resulting in environment-aware systems that can enable intelligent decision making, with one such example being smart satellite networks. However, smart satellite networks attract the attention of hackers, resulting in them being targeted by severe cyber-attacks that can compromise their integrity, affect their availability, or breach the confidentiality of the data they generate, collect or rout. Lately, several prominent cyber-attacking scenarios have been observed to target IoT-enabled systems, resulting in loss, alteration, or exfiltration of data, disabling of devices, (distributed) denial of services, the formation of botnets, and lateral movement into otherwise secured networks. In this paper, we propose a network forensic framework based on Deep Learning (DL), the so-called Intelligent Satellite Deep Learning Network Forensic (INSAT-DLNF), for the detection and tracing of cyber-attack activities targeting smart satellite networks. For this framework, we trained a Long Short-term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and compared their performances to five supervised and two unsupervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. The experimental results indicate that ML and DL algorithms can be employed effectively for the discovery and tracing of cyber-attacks, resulting in more adaptive and resilient cyber-security solutions, compared to legacy forensic tools that cannot discover zero-day attack surfaces and vectors.","author":[{"family":"Koroniotis","given":"Nickolaos"},{"family":"Moustafa","given":"Nour"},{"family":"Slay","given":"Jill"}],"citation-key":"koroniotisNewIntelligentSatellite2022","container-title":"Computers and Electrical Engineering","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compeleceng.2022.107745","ISSN":"0045-7906","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"page":"107745","title":"A new Intelligent Satellite Deep Learning Network Forensic framework for smart satellite networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045790622000556","volume":"99"},
  {"id":"koteyBlockchainInteroperabilityState2023","abstract":"Blockchain technology has been increasingly adopted over the past few years since the introduction of Bitcoin, with several blockchain architectures and solutions being proposed. Most proposed solutions have been developed in isolation, without a standard protocol or cryptographic structure to work with. This has led to the problem of interoperability, where solutions running on different blockchain platforms are unable to communicate, limiting the scope of use. With blockchains being adopted in a variety of fields such as the Internet of Things, it is expected that the problem of interoperability if not addressed quickly, will stifle technology advancement. This paper presents the current state of interoperability solutions proposed for heterogenous blockchain systems. A look is taken at interoperability solutions, not only for cryptocurrencies, but also for general data-based use cases. Current open issues in heterogenous blockchain interoperability are presented. Additionally, some possible research directions are presented to enhance and to extend the existing blockchain interoperability solutions. It was discovered that though there are a number of proposed solutions in literature, few have seen real-world implementation. The lack of blockchain-specific standards has slowed the progress of interoperability. It was also realized that most of the proposed solutions are developed targeting cryptocurrency-based applications.","author":[{"family":"Kotey","given":"Seth Djanie"},{"family":"Tchao","given":"Eric Tutu"},{"family":"Ahmed","given":"Abdul-Rahman"},{"family":"Agbemenu","given":"Andrew Selasi"},{"family":"Nunoo-Mensah","given":"Henry"},{"family":"Sikora","given":"Axel"},{"family":"Welte","given":"Dominik"},{"family":"Keelson","given":"Eliel"}],"citation-key":"koteyBlockchainInteroperabilityState2023","container-title":"IET COMMUNICATIONS","DOI":"10.1049/cmu2.12594","ISSN":"1751-8628","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,5]]},"page":"891-914","title":"Blockchain interoperability: the state of heterogenous blockchain-to-blockchain communication","type":"article-journal","volume":"17"},

  {"id":"krishnaComprehensiveSurveyPandemic2023","abstract":"Sporadic occurrences of transmissible diseases have severe and long-lasting effects on humankind throughout history. These outbreaks have molded the political, economic, and social aspects of human life. Pandemics have redefined some of the basic beliefs of modern healthcare, pushing researchers and scientists to develop innovative solutions to be better equipped for future emergencies. Numerous attempts have been made to fight Covid-19-like pandemics using technologies such as the Internet of Things, wireless body area network, blockchain, and machine learning. Since the disease is highly contagious, novel research in patients' health monitoring system is essential for the constant monitoring of pandemic patients with minimal or no human intervention. With the ongoing pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, popularly known as Covid-19, innovations for monitoring of patients' vitals and storing them securely have risen more than ever. Analyzing the stored patients' data can further assist healthcare workers in their decision-making process. In this paper, we surveyed the research works on remote monitoring of pandemic patients admitted in hospitals or quarantined at home. First, an overview of pandemic patient monitoring is given followed by a brief introduction of enabling technologies i.e. Internet of Things, blockchain, and machine learning to implement the system. The reviewed works have been classified into three categories; remote monitoring of pandemic patients using IoT, blockchain-based storage or sharing platforms for patients' data, and processing/analyzing the stored patients' data using machine learning for prognosis and diagnosis. We also identified several open research issues to set directions for future research.","author":[{"family":"Krishna","given":"Charu"},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Dinesh"},{"family":"Kushwaha","given":"Dharmender Singh"}],"citation-key":"krishnaComprehensiveSurveyPandemic2023","container-title":"WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS","DOI":"10.1007/s11277-023-10535-9","ISSN":"0929-6212","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,8]]},"page":"2125-2172","title":"A Comprehensive Survey on Pandemic Patient Monitoring System: Enabling Technologies, Opportunities, and Research Challenges","type":"article-journal","volume":"131"},
  {"id":"krithikaSurveyApplicationsBlockchain2022","abstract":"Dating back many millennia, agriculture is an ancient practice in the evolution of civilization. It was developed when humans thought about it and concluded that not everyone in the community was required to produce food. Instead, specialized labor, tools, and techniques could help people achieve surplus food for their community. Since then, agriculture has continuously evolved across the ages and has occupied a vital, synergistic position in the existence of humanity. The evolution of agriculture was based on a compulsion to feed the growing population, and, importantly, maintain the quality and traceability of food, prevent counterfeit products, and modernize and optimize yield. Recent trends and advancements in blockchain technology have some significant attributes that are ideal for agriculture. The invention and implementation of blockchain have caused a fair share of positive disruptions and evolutionary adoption in agriculture to modernize the domain. Blockchain has been adopted at various stages of the agriculture lifecycle for improved evolution. This work presents an intense survey of the literature on how blockchain has positively impacted and continues to influence various market verticals in agriculture, the challenges and the future.","author":[{"family":"Krithika","given":"L.

The underwater monitoring of the oceans and their surroundings is highly crucial from several perspectives, e.g., to unearth the hidden minerals/oils, to monitor the life of underwater species, military and rescue applications, surveillance of maritime borders, and predict tidal wave behaviors among others. The exploration and inspection activities of the underwater environment are mainly performed remotely by unmanned underwater vehicles or robots because human direct involvement in such a complex environment might not be a feasible option. Moreover, the recent maturity in digital automation and underwater drone technology along with the emergence and improvements in wireless, communication, and sensing technologies had already encouraged the research community to drive deep into this domain. Among several disruptive enabling technologies, Blockchain has emerged as a vital enabling technology to fulfil key requirements for secure data sharing, storage, process tracking, collaboration, and resource management. This study presents a comprehensive review of the utilization of Blockchain in different underwater applications, discussing various use cases along with detailing blockchainbased architectures, potential challenges, solutions, and future research directions. Potential challenges of underwater applications addressed by Blockchain have been detailed.

  {"id":"kumarDesignIntelligentCyber2021","abstract":"With simple connectivity and fast-growing demand of smart devices and networks, IoT has become more prone to cyber attacks. In order to detect and prevent cyber attacks in IoT networks, intrusion detection system (IDS) plays a crucial role. However, most of the existing IDS have dimensionality curse that reduces overall IoT systems efﬁciency. Hence, it is important to remove repetitive and irrelevant features while designing effective IDS. Motivated from aforementioned challenges, this paper presents an intelligent cyber attack detection system for IoT network using a novel hybrid feature reduced approach. This technique ﬁrst performs feature ranking using correlation coefﬁcient, random forest mean decrease accuracy and gain ratio to obtain three different feature sets. Then, features are combined using a suitably designed mechanism (AND operation), to obtain single optimized feature set. Finally, the obtained reduced feature set is fed to three well-known machine learning algorithms such as random forest, K-nearest neighbor and XGBoost for detection of cyber attacks. The efﬁciency of the proposed cyber attack detection framework is evaluated using NSL-KDD and two latest IoT-based datasets namely, BoT-IoT and DS2OS. Performance of the proposed framework is evaluated and compared with some recent state-of-the-art techniques found in literature, in terms of accuracy, detection rate (DR), precision and F1 score. Performance analysis using these three datasets shows that the proposed model has achieved DR up to 90%–100%, for most of the attack vectors that has close similarity to normal behaviors and accuracy above 99%.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Kumar","given":"Prabhat"},{"family":"Gupta","given":"Govind P."},{"family":"Tripathi","given":"Rakesh"}],"citation-key":"kumarDesignIntelligentCyber2021","container-title":"Arabian Journal for Science and Engineering","container-title-short":"Arab J Sci Eng","DOI":"10.1007/s13369-020-05181-3","ISSN":"2193-567X, 2191-4281","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4]]},"language":"en","page":"3749-3778","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Toward Design of an Intelligent Cyber Attack Detection System using Hybrid Feature Reduced Approach for IoT Networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13369-020-05181-3","volume":"46"},

  {"id":"kumarDistributedEnergyResources2020","abstract":"Smart grid (SG), an evolving concept in the modern power infrastructure, enables the two-way flow of electricity and data between the peers within the electricity system networks (ESN) and its clusters. The self-healing capabilities of SG allow the peers to become active partakers in ESN. In general, the SG is intended to replace the fossil fuel-rich conventional grid with the distributed energy resources (DER) and pools numerous existing and emerging know-hows like information and digital communications technologies together to manage countless operations. With this, the SG will able to “detect, react, and pro-act” to changes in usage and address multiple issues, thereby ensuring timely grid operations. However, the “detect, react, and pro-act” features in DER-based SG can only be accomplished at the fullest level with the use of technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and the Blockchain (BC). The techniques associated with AI include fuzzy logic, knowledge-based systems, and neural networks. They have brought advances in controlling DER-based SG. The IoT and BC have also enabled various services like data sensing, data storage, secured, transparent, and traceable digital transactions among ESN peers and its clusters. These promising technologies have gone through fast technological evolution in the past decade, and their applications have increased rapidly in ESN. Hence, this study discusses the SG and applications of AI, IoT, and BC. First, a comprehensive survey of the DER, power electronics components and their control, electric vehicles (EVs) as load components, and communication and cybersecurity issues are carried out. Second, the role played by AI-based analytics, IoT components along with energy internet architecture, and the BC assistance in improving SG services are thoroughly discussed. This study revealed that AI, IoT, and BC provide automated services to peers by monitoring real-time information about the ESN, thereby enhancing reliability, availability, resilience, stability, security, and sustainability.","author":[{"family":"Kumar","given":"Nallapaneni Manoj"},{"family":"Chand","given":"Aneesh A."},{"family":"Malvoni","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Prasad","given":"Kushal A."},{"family":"Mamun","given":"Kabir A."},{"family":"Islam","given":"F.

  {"id":"kumariApplicationBlockchainInternet2023","abstract":"The blockchain with IoT technology aids organizations in achieving authenticity across peer-to-peer nodes, including keeping evidence of work, cutting out mediators, traceability, and so on. Increased input expenses and supply chain mechanisms that prevent direct connections between producers and consumers of the food and beverage industry have an impact on data gathering, safety, and exchange. Because of the lack of centralized IoT infrastructure, restrictions on data protection, tampering, and single-point breakdown are not met. The study suggests an IoT paradigm built on blockchain to overcome these problems. Additionally, this work demonstrates novel energy savings. This paper suggests a smart model framework for multiple IoT systems that observe crop growth and the agricultural surroundings and offer an open, decentralized blockchain monitoring system. At many stages of the supply chain management (SCM) procedures, it can be used in blockchain. All activities in decentralized supply systems were managed by smart agreements. Every 500 m2 cluster farm received a sum of 100 IoT units randomly. Nodes from the IoTs were utilized to measure data on food and beverage production. The suggested frameworks' duration of network stability and network lifespan show 90.4% accuracy. This study also collects secondary data from executives in the food and beverage sectors throughout India with an understanding of blockchain with IoT and SCM processes. The supply chain operations such as purchasing, pre-processing, transportation, warehouse, retail, management of inventory, distribution, and marketing operations were taken into consideration when analyzing. The blockchain and IoT offered the biggest benefits, namely cost savings, traceability, time savings, immutability, validation, and work proof, relying on the analysis of data.","author":[{"family":"Kumari","given":"B.

  {"id":"kumarIIoTImplementationChallenges2022","abstract":"Purpose The purpose of this methodology is to categorise the challenges into cause and effect group. The modern scenario of customization, personalization and multi-restrictive working because of pandemics has affected the operations of manufacturing small and medium enterprises (SMEs). In the new normal, the digitalization of manufacturing SMEs can be the path breaker. Modern digitalization includes a mix of technologies such as the industrial internet of things (IIoT), the internet of things, cyber-physical system and big data analytics. This digitalization can help in achieving new design changes, efficient production scheduling, smart manufacturing and unrestricted on-time delivery of quality products. This research paper aims to recognize and analyze the challenges faced while implementing IIoT technologies in manufacturing SMEs and tries to find the possibility of mitigating challenges by blockchain technology. Design/methodology/approach There were ten challenges of IIoT implementation identified from the literature review and experts' opinions. To collect information from Indian manufacturing SMEs, a survey tool was formed in the form of a questionnaire. On the fundament of responses received from industrial experts, the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMA℡) technique has been used for categorizing these challenges into cause and effect groups. Further, the authors tried to mitigate observed challenges with the help of blockchain technology. Findings With the implementation of IIoT technologies, the manufacturing processes become conciliatory, effective and traceable in real time. Observation of the current study states that the top effect group challenges such as the security of data and reliability of technologies can be mitigated by enabling blockchain technologies. The authors conclude that blockchain-enabled IIoT technologies will be highly beneficial for the Indian SMEs strategically and practically in the current scenario. Research limitations/implications Methodology of DEMA℡ focuses on responses received from experts. The broader approach of survey from manufacturing organizations is compromised due to small sample size in this methodology. Experts approached for survey were from manufacturing SMEs of Delhi National Capital Region only. Broader survey-based techniques may be applied covering different sectors of SMEs in future work. Practical implications Technologies such as blockchain can facilitate advanced security in the application of IIoT and other such practices. While dealing with significant issues and challenges of new technologies, blockchain gives an edge of balance in the current scenario. Its properties of fixity, temper evident and circumvent fraud make this technology ideal for the digitalization of the manufacturing systems in SMEs. Originality/value Digitalization of manufacturing facilities is the need of the hour. Pandemic challenges have highlighted the urgency of it. This research will motivate and guide the manufacturing SMEs in planning strategies and long-term policies in implementing modern technologies and coping up with the pandemic challenges.","author":[{"family":"Kumar","given":"Ravinder"},{"family":"Sindhwani","given":"Rahul"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Punj Lata"}],"citation-key":"kumarIIoTImplementationChallenges2022","container-title":"JOURNAL OF GLOBAL OPERATIONS AND STRATEGIC SOURCING","DOI":"10.1108/JGOSS-08-2021-0056","ISSN":"2398-5364","issue":"3, SI","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,5]]},"page":"363-379","title":"IIoT implementation challenges: analysis and mitigation by blockchain","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"kumarIntellectualIntrusionDetection2022","abstract":"Smart devices are connected to the internet, called the Internet of Things (IoT); it is a wireless network that plays a vital role in modernizing people’s interaction by improving agility, mobility, efficiency and effectiveness. Although IoT offers various advantages, it also raises privacy and security problems in IoT networks. The security of such integrated networks still remains an active area of research. Information transported across a wireless network must be monitored and implemented efficiently to ensure its integrity, validity and confidentiality. In order to minimize the rate of security problems in IoT networks, an intrusion detection model is suggested. For that reason, various intrusion detection based techniques are introduced in existing works to improve the security of IoT networks. But existing methods do not provide an efficient result in securing IoT data. The main contribution of using intrusion detection techniques in the proposed work is to improve the security of IoT networks. In this work, a hybrid Hunger Games Search and Remora Optimization Algorithm (HHGS-ROA) is proposed to address the security problems. The proposed approach uses a real-world Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion Dataset (AWID) for an IoT intruder detection system. Initially, the AWID raw captured traffic is fed into the pre-processing stage to increase the speed of feature selection. In the proposed approach, a hybrid HGS-ROA model is used to extract the features from the AWID dataset. Finally, the SVM classifier is proposed to classify network traffic as normal or malicious attacks. Therefore proposed approach achieves a low false-positive rate (FPR) with an enhanced detection rate. The proposed work is implemented in the PYTHON platform. Compared with existing methods in terms of accuracy, F1 score, detection rate, FAR, computation times, false alarm rate, MCC, and precision has proven to be more effective. The proposed approach performs better than existing algorithms in terms of evaluating metrics such as accuracy (99.16%), precision (99.76%), recall (99.40%), F1 score (99.58%), false alarm rate (0.00005%), MCC (99.97%) and false-positive rate (0.20%).","author":[{"family":"Kumar","given":"Ravinder"},{"family":"Malik","given":"Amita"},{"family":"Ranga","given":"Virender"}],"citation-key":"kumarIntellectualIntrusionDetection2022","container-title":"Knowledge-Based Systems","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2022.109762","ISSN":"0950-7051","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"page":"109762","title":"An intellectual intrusion detection system using Hybrid Hunger Games Search and Remora Optimization Algorithm for IoT wireless networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705122008917","volume":"256"},

  {"id":"kumarMachineLearningbasedEarly2022","abstract":"In this work, we present an IoT botnet detection solution, EDIMA, consisting of a set of lightweight modules designed to be deployed at the edge gateway installed in home networks with the remaining modules expected to be implemented on cloud servers. EDIMA targets early detection of IoT botnets prior to the launch of an attack and includes a novel two-stage Machine Learning (ML)-based detector developed specifically for IoT bot detection at the edge gateway. The ML-based bot detector first employs supervised ML algorithms for aggregate traffic classification and subsequently Autocorrelation Function (ACF)-based tests to detect individual bots. The EDIMA architecture also comprises a malware traffic database, a policy engine, a feature extractor and a traffic parser. Performance evaluation results using our testbed setup with real-world IoT malware traffic as well as other public IoT datasets show that EDIMA achieves high bot scanning and bot-CnC traffic detection accuracies with very low false positive rates. The detection performance is also shown to be robust to an increase in the number of IoT devices connected to the edge gateway where EDIMA is deployed. Further, the runtime performance analysis of a Python implementation of EDIMA deployed on a Raspberry Pi reveals low bot detection delays and low RAM consumption. EDIMA is also shown to outperform existing detection techniques for bot scanning traffic and bot-CnC server communication.","author":[{"family":"Kumar","given":"Ayush"},{"family":"Shridhar","given":"Mrinalini"},{"family":"Swaminathan","given":"Sahithya"},{"family":"Lim","given":"Teng Joon"}],"citation-key":"kumarMachineLearningbasedEarly2022","container-title":"Computers & Security","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2022.102693","ISSN":"0167-4048","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"page":"102693","title":"Machine learning-based early detection of IoT botnets using network-edge traffic","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404822000918","volume":"117"},

  {"id":"kumarRevolutionaryStrategiesAnalysis2022","abstract":"The Internet of Things (IoT) has changed the worldwide network of people, smart devices, intelligent things, data, and information as an emergent technology. IoT development is still in its early stages, and numerous interrelated challenges must be addressed. IoT is the unifying idea of embedding everything. The Internet of Things offers a huge opportunity to improve the world's accessibility, integrity, availability, scalability, confidentiality, and interoperability. However, securing the Internet of Things is a difficult issue. The IoT aims to connect almost everything within the framework of a common infrastructure. This helps in controlling devices and, will allow device status to be updated everywhere and at any time. To develop technology via IoT, several critical scientific studies and inquiries have been carried out. However, many obstacles and problems remain to be tackled in order to reach IoT's maximum potential. These problems and concerns must be taken into consideration in different areas of the IoT, such as implementation in remote areas, threats to the system, development support, social and environmental impacts, etc. This paper reviews the current state of the art in different IoT architectures, with a focus on current technologies, applications, challenges, IoT protocols, and opportunities. As a result, a detailed taxonomy of IoT is presented here which includes interoperability, scalability, security and energy efficiency, among other things. Moreover, the significance of blockchains and big data as well as their analysis in relation to IoT, is discussed. This article aims to help readers and researchers understand the IoT and its applicability to the real world.","author":[{"family":"Kumar","given":"Arun"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Sharad"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Aman"},{"family":"Alwadain","given":"Ayed"},{"family":"Choi","given":"Bong-Jun"},{"family":"Manual-Brenosa","given":"Jose"},{"family":"Ortega-Mansilla","given":"Arturo"},{"family":"Goyal","given":"Nitin"}],"citation-key":"kumarRevolutionaryStrategiesAnalysis2022","container-title":"SUSTAINABILITY","DOI":"10.3390/su14010071","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1]]},"title":"Revolutionary Strategies Analysis and Proposed System for Future Infrastructure in Internet of Things","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"lardosarebeloInterplayInternetThings2022","abstract":"Purpose This study aims to identify and analyze how Internet of things (IoT) technology affects supply chain management (SCM) performance. Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review was conducted (using Scopus, JSTOR, Emerald, ProQuest, Science Direct and Web of Science) covering a 20-year timeframe (2000-2020). Out of 2,572 papers identified, 171 peer-reviewed papers from the most important journals were selected. Content analysis was used following the Global Supply Chain Forum (GSCF) SCM framework. Findings Regarding the GSCF SCM framework processes, most IoT-based studies have addressed improving order fulfilment, manufacturing flow management and demand management processes. However, no studies addressing the Supplier relationship management process were identified, suggesting that IoT-based applications are perceived to add more value in downstream than upstream SCM processes. The importance of using enabling technologies to realize the potential of value generation of IoT was also revealed. Findings suggest new research avenues related to product development and commercialization process, the supplier relationship management process, the returns management process, servitization strategies, new SCM models and new business models. Research limitations/implications The review encompasses only academic papers from journals considered the most relevant (retrieved from specific databases), using the impact factor as the quality criterion. Practical implications The findings can help business managers better understand the potential of IoT technology, such as the main applications identified in the literature and their impacts on SCM processes. Their importance in enabling technologies to leverage SCM performance is identified and the emerging SCM models/business models that IoT deployment can enable are highlighted. Originality/value This study contributes to filling a gap in the literature using a systematic literature review of how IoT technology affects SCM performance through content analysis, using an SCM framework to clarify which SCM processes are affected. Academic articles from the most important journals from 2000 to 2020 are identified.","author":[{"family":"Lardosa Rebelo","given":"Romulo Marcos"},{"family":"Farias Pereira","given":"Susana Carla"},{"family":"Queiroz","given":"Maciel M."}],"citation-key":"lardosarebeloInterplayInternetThings2022","container-title":"BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL","DOI":"10.1108/BIJ-02-2021-0085","ISSN":"1463-5771","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,10]]},"page":"683-711","title":"The interplay between the Internet of things and supply chain management: challenges and opportunities based on a systematic literature review","type":"article-journal","volume":"29"},

In this study, we build predictive models with Bot-IoT to detect attacks represented by dataset instances from the Information Theft category, as well as dataset instances from the data exfiltration and keylogging subcategories. Our contribution is centered on the evaluation of ensemble feature selection techniques (FSTs) on classification performance for these specific attack instances. A group or ensemble of FSTs will often perform better than the best individual technique. The classifiers that we use are a diverse set of four ensemble learners (Light GBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, and random forest (RF)) and four non-ensemble learners (logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)). The metrics used for evaluating classification performance are area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Area Under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). For the most part, we determined that our ensemble FSTs do not affect classification performance but are beneficial because feature reduction eases computational burden and provides insight through improved data visualization. © 2022, The Author(s).","author":[{"family":"Leevy","given":"J.

  {"id":"leExploringLocalExplanation2023","abstract":"In recent years, numerous explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) use cases have been developed, to solve numerous real problems in industrial applications while maintaining the explainability level of the used artificial intelligence (AI) models to judge their quality and potentially hold the models accountable if they become corrupted. Therefore, understanding the state-of-the-art methods, pointing out recent issues, and deriving future directions are important to drive XAI research efficiently. This paper presents a systematic literature review of local explanation techniques and their practical applications in various industrial sectors. We first establish the need for XAI in response to opaque AI models and survey different local explanation methods for industrial AI applications. The number of studies is then examined with several factors, including industry sectors, AI models, data types, and XAI-based usage and purpose. We also look at the advantages and disadvantages of local explanation methods and how well they work in practical settings. The difficulties of using local explanation techniques are also covered, including computing complexity and the trade-off between precision and interpretability. Our findings demonstrate that local explanation techniques can boost industrial AI models' transparency and interpretability and give insightful information about them. The efficiency of these procedures must be improved, and ethical concerns about their application must be resolved. This paper contributes to the increasing knowledge of local explanation strategies and offers guidance to academics and industry professionals who want to use these methods in practical settings.","author":[{"family":"Le","given":"Thi-Thu-Huong"},{"family":"Prihatno","given":"Aji Teguh"},{"family":"Oktian","given":"Yustus Eko"},{"family":"Kang","given":"Hyoeun"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Howon"}],"citation-key":"leExploringLocalExplanation2023","container-title":"APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL","DOI":"10.3390/app13095809","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,8]]},"title":"Exploring Local Explanation of Practical Industrial AI Applications: A Systematic Literature Review","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"lianIdentityBasedIdentityConcealedAuthenticated2021","abstract":"Identity-based authenticated key exchange (ID-AKE) allows two parties (whose identities are just their public keys) to agree on a shared session key over open channels. At ESORICS 2019, Tomida et al. proposed a highly efficient ID-AKE protocol, referred to as the TFNS19-protocol, under the motivation of providing authentication and secure communication for huge number of low-power IoT devices. The TFNS19-protocol currently stands for the most efficient ID-AKE based on bilinear pairings, where each user remarkably performs only a single pairing operation. But it does not consider users' identity privacy, and the security is based on relatively non-standard assumptions. In this work, we formulate and design identity-based identity-concealed AKE (IB-CAKE) protocols. Here, identity concealment means that the session transcript does not leak users' identity information. We present a simple and highly practical IB-CAKE protocol, which is computationally more efficient than the remarkable TFNS19-protocol in total. We present a new security model for IB-CAKE, and show it is stronger than the ID-eCK model used for the TFNS19-protocol. The security of our IB-CAKE protocol is proved under relatively standard assumptions in the random oracle model, assuming the security of the underlying authenticated encryption and the gap bilinear Diffie-Hellman (Gap-BDH) problem. Finally, we provide the implementation results for the proposed IB-CAKE scheme, and present performance benchmark.","author":[{"family":"Lian","given":"Huanhuan"},{"family":"Pan","given":"Tianyu"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Huige"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Yunlei"}],"citation-key":"lianIdentityBasedIdentityConcealedAuthenticated2021","collection-title":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science","container-title":"COMPUTER SECURITY - ESORICS 2021, PT II","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-88428-4_32","editor":[{"family":"Bertino","given":"E"},{"family":"Shulman","given":"H"},{"family":"Waidner","given":"M"}],"ISBN":"978-3-030-88428-4 978-3-030-88427-7","ISSN":"0302-9743","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"page":"651-675","publisher":"Inst Mines Telecom; Inst Polytechnique Paris; Univ Autonoma Barcelona; Univ Politecnica Catalunya; UNESCO Chair Data Privacy; Cybercat; Inria; IRT SYSTEMX; Bandit","title":"Identity-Based Identity-Concealed Authenticated Key Exchange","type":"paper-conference","volume":"12973"},
  {"id":"liaoBlockchainSemiDistributedLearningBased2022","abstract":"Power systems impose stringent security and delay requirements on computation offloading, which cannot be satisfied by existing power Internet of Things (PIoT) networks. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by combining blockchain, space-air-ground integrated PIoT (SAG-PIoT) and machine learning. Low earth orbit (LEO) satellites assist in broadcasting a consensus message to reduce the block creation delay, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide flexible coverage enhancement. Specifically, we propose a Blockchain and semi-distributed leaRning-based secure and low-latency electromAgnetic interferenCe-awarE computation offloading algorithm (BRACE) to minimize the total queuing delay under the long-term security constraint. First, the task offloading is decoupled from the computational resource allocation by Lyapunov optimization. Second, the task offloading problem is solved by the proposed federated deep actor-critic-based electromagnetic interference-aware task offloading algorithm (FDAC-EMI). Finally, the resource allocation problem is solved by smooth approximation and Lagrange optimization. Simulation results verify that BRACE achieves superior delay and security performance.","author":[{"family":"Liao","given":"Haijun"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhao"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Zhenyu"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yang"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Hui"},{"family":"Mumtaz","given":"Shahid"},{"family":"Guizani","given":"Mohsen"}],"citation-key":"liaoBlockchainSemiDistributedLearningBased2022","container-title":"IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN SIGNAL PROCESSING","DOI":"10.1109/JSTSP.2021.3135751","ISSN":"1932-4553","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,4]]},"page":"381-394","title":"Blockchain and Semi-Distributed Learning-Based Secure and Low-Latency Computation Offloading in Space-Air-Ground-Integrated Power IoT","type":"article-journal","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"liBlockchainbasedTrustManagement2021","abstract":"Through virtualization and resource integration, cloud computing has expanded its service area and offers a better user experience than the traditional platforms, along with its business operation model bringing huge economic and social benefits. However, a large amount of evidence shows that cloud computing is facing with serious security and trust crisis, and building a trust-enabled transaction environment has become its key factor. The traditional cloud trust model usually adopts a centralized architecture, which causes large management overhead, network congestion and even single point of failure. Furthermore, due to a lack of transparency and traceability, trust evaluation results cannot be fully recognized by all participants. Blockchain is a new and promising decentralized framework and distributed computing paradigm. Its unique features in operating rules and traceability of records ensure the integrity, undeniability and security of the transaction data. Therefore, blockchain is very suitable for constructing a distributed and decentralized trust architecture. This paper carries out a comprehensive survey on blockchain-based trust approaches in cloud computing systems. Based on a novel cloud-edge trust management framework and a double-blockchain structure based cloud transaction model, it identifies the open challenges and gives directions for future research in this field.","author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Wenjuan"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Jiyi"},{"family":"Cao","given":"Jian"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Nan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Qifei"},{"family":"Buyya","given":"Rajkumar"}],"citation-key":"liBlockchainbasedTrustManagement2021","container-title":"JOURNAL OF CLOUD COMPUTING-ADVANCES SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS","DOI":"10.1186/s13677-021-00247-5","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,21]]},"title":"Blockchain-based trust management in cloud computing systems: a taxonomy, review and future directions","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},

However, during the construction and operation of 5G, telecom operators face many challenges, such as insufficient frequency resources, low efficiency of network management, information opacity, risks of data interoperability, and network privacy vulnerabilities. As 5G is generally deployed in heterogeneous networks with massive ubiquitous devices, it is quite necessary to provide secure and decentralized solutions. Blockchain is a distributed system maintained by multiple parties with inherit features including decentralization, traceability and tamperproof. These features collectively contribute to a new application ecosystem where transactions are secure and trustworthy. Therefore, blockchain is expected to integrate with 5G networks to build safer and more reliable mobile network infrastructures. This paper firstly discusses the merits of blockchain technology and the benefits of integrating it with 5G networks. Then a variety of applications of blockchain technology in telecom network operation are reviewed, including spectrum sharing, international roaming settlement, network operation management, number selection management and supply chain management.

Although it has brought us great convenience, there are also suffered from security vulnerabilities and potential threats. Currently, the lack of protection mechanisms for IoT devices with limited resources makes it easy to be attacked. In this paper, we design an intrusion detection system to protect the IoT security. The system uses supervised learning to achieve two main functions: (1) classify the generated malicious traffic; (2) identify the types of attacks. Besides, we propose a lightweight feature selection method, which uses a small number of features to evaluate the two functions. As a result, in the classification experiments, the proposed method automatically extracts 29 and 9 from 88 features, and then the designed system achieves a high accuracy rate of 98.7% and 98.99%. This means that our method still has great accuracy by taking a small number of features.","author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Taotao"},{"family":"Hong","given":"Zhen"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Li"}],"citation-key":"liMachineLearningbasedIntrusion2020","collection-title":"IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation ICCA","container-title":"2020 IEEE 16TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONTROL & AUTOMATION (ICCA)","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"page":"277-282","title":"Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection for IoT Devices in Smart Home","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"liSurveyStateoftheartSharding2023","abstract":"Blockchain has been widely used in various fields, such as health management, finance, the Internet of Things (IoT), identity management, and supply chains. However, the performance of blockchain, including its throughput and transaction processing latency, has hindered its large-scale practical application, which is known as the scalability issue of blockchain. Many on-chain and off-chain solutions have been proposed to solve this problem, such as directed acyclic graph (DAG) blockchain and Rollup schemes. Despite these schemes' ability to enhance the scalability of the blockchain, they compromise on other essential properties. The consensus is that the DAG blockchain can never provide deterministic security for transactions, and Rollup is disputed because it makes a trade-off of decentralization for scalability. Sharding technology is a proposed solution for these limitations, promising to tackle the scalability issue while maintaining security and decentralization at the same time. To date, no survey has been done on sharding design models and their key components and corresponding attack surfaces. To fill this gap, in this survey, we first provide a detailed analysis and comparison of both permissioned and permissionless sharding blockchains. Then, we describe the common building blocks chosen by the above sharding schemes as key components. Finally, we investigate how these components may be attacked and suggest corresponding countermeasures. Several open challenges are also given as future research directions. The survey aims to help researchers, engineers, and educators quickly grasp a consolidated body of knowledge about current sharding blockchain development.","author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Yi"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jinsong"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Hongwei"}],"citation-key":"liSurveyStateoftheartSharding2023","container-title":"JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS","DOI":"10.1016/j.jnca.2023.103686","ISSN":"1084-8045","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,8]]},"title":"A survey of state-of-the-art sharding blockchains: Models, components, and attack surfaces","type":"article-journal","volume":"217"},

Recently, blockchain technology and its benefits have received wide attention and interest. This research synthesizes the research trends and needs of this growing area by means of a bibliometric-qualitative review method. Scopus and Web of Science were selected as the literature databases to retrieve relevant academic publications. Through a systematic literature search and screening, 181 related articles were identified for bibliometric analysis, and 149 publications were critically discussed in a qualitative review. The bibliometric results indicated the recent research regarding blockchain in construction is primarily directed into several clusters, such as “smart contract,” “Building Information Modeling (BIM),” “supply chain management,” “construction contract,” “construction and project management,” “digital twin,” and “smart city.” These clusters were further synthesized for a qualitative review revealing deep insight into research challenges and gaps. Both quantitative and qualitative review results were then mapped to the future directions. It was noted that future research needs to focus on (1) quantifying the cost-benefits of the blockchain applications in construction, e.g., return on investment, practitioners training, and improving industry readiness, (2) integration of blockchain with different project delivery systems, and (3) technology fusion with blockchain for construction management.","author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Hexu"},{"family":"Han","given":"SangHyeok"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Zhenhua"}],"citation-key":"liuBlockchainTechnologySmart2023","container-title":"JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT","DOI":"10.1061/JCEMD4.COENG-11929","ISSN":"0733-9364","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,1]]},"title":"Blockchain Technology toward Smart Construction: Review and Future Directions","type":"article-journal","volume":"149"},
  {"id":"liuCommunitychainScalableBlockchain2023","abstract":"Rapid development of smart homes in recent years has led to the production of an increasing number of smart devices that meet people's daily needs. However, these smart devices may belong to different vendors and provide different functions and services, making it difficult to apply a centralized solution to a smart home system. Although blockchain has the potential to address the potential problems of smart homes because of its features such as nontampering, decentralization, and security, scalability remains a key challenge when integrating blockchain and smart homes, which is mainly reflected in the horizontal expansion, throughput and latency of the system. To address this challenge, Communitychain-a new scalable blockchain architecture suitable for smart home systems composing heterogeneous devices-is proposed in this study. A community model based on sharding that enables the architecture to adapt to an increase in the number of nodes is designed, which includes new miner nodes and leader node selection algorithms. Efficient cross-shard routing and sideBlock schemes are adopted to improve the throughput and latency and enhance the scalability of the system. Furthermore, lightweight authorization and authentication processes running in each community ensure secure access to device resources. The experimental results indicate that the proposed blockchain architecture can effectively improve the scalability of blockchain-based smart homes and adapt well to the system dynamics.","author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Gang"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Zhenping"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Yufei"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Kang","given":"Hongzhaoning"}],"citation-key":"liuCommunitychainScalableBlockchain2023","container-title":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORK AND SERVICE MANAGEMENT","DOI":"10.1109/TNSM.2023.3241136","ISSN":"1932-4537","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,9]]},"page":"2898-2911","title":"Communitychain: Toward a Scalable Blockchain in Smart Home","type":"article-journal","volume":"20"},
  {"id":"liuCPAHPConditionalPrivacyPreserving2023","abstract":"As a representative application scenario of the Internet of Things (IoT), the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) plays an important function in the area of intelligent transportation. However, data traffic exchanged in IoV is usually correlated with plenty of sensitive information, thus leading to privacy leakage. Nevertheless, if all personal data about vehicles are completely protected, it will be hard to trace the real identities of malicious vehicles, which also raises other security issues in IoV. In addition, existing schemes are not fully suitable for 5G-enabled IoV due to their complex structure and high computation requirements. In order to realize more efficient communication and anonymous authentication of vehicles with superior security, we propose a conditional privacy-preserving authentication scheme with hierarchical pseudonyms (CPAHP) in 5G-enabled IoV, which is based on the elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) problem. Through the hierarchical pseudonym mechanism, CPAHP can protect the real identities and movement tracks of vehicles. Whereas, if vehicles have malicious behaviors, their real identities can be recovered through the corresponding pseudonyms. Furthermore, by taking advantage of a batch verification method, receivers can easily cope with a huge influx of messages in a short space of time. Moreover, by introducing blockchain technology, traffic information can be shared smoothly among all vehicles. Through the security analysis and performance evaluation, it is demonstrated that CPAHP can not only meet the security requirements but also provide higher computational efficiency.","author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Jingwei"},{"family":"Peng","given":"Chuntian"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Rong"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Ning"},{"family":"Dustdar","given":"Schahram"},{"family":"Leung","given":"Victor C.

  {"id":"liuKCBBCSSEKeywordComplete2021","abstract":"Internet of things (IoT) devices generate a massive amount of data every second in our lives. While cloud storage brings convenience to the users, it has the disadvantages of low scalability and weak reliability. Blockchain-based distributed storage eliminates data loss due to the tamper-resistant characteristic. Nonetheless, blockchain storage raises some confidentiality and retrieval efficiency issues of data. Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) is an effective search scheme based on ciphertexts, which ensures data security. However, with the increase of data on the blockchain, the data retrieval on the blockchain will be difficult. In this paper, a Complete Binary Tree Searchable Symmetric Encryption using Blockchain (KCB-BC-SSE) scheme is proposed. According to the number of searchers, the scheme is divided into single searcher and multiple searchers where the search efficiency is improved in theory. And the simulation on ethereum shows the feasibility of our scheme. The security analysis illustrates our scheme achieves security under the chosen keyword attack. (C) 2021 The Authors.

  {"id":"liuTrustedProofMechanism2022","abstract":"In smart city, technologies such as blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing tend to be integrated that promotes horizontal information exchange and multi-party cooperation. Large amounts of superior services can be provided by analyzing the information. However, lots of IoT devices generating the information do not have sufficient resources to resist malicious attacks so that the devices deliberately upload the tampered data, which reduces quality of service. To solve the problem, we propose a data source trusted proof mechanism based on the node security measurement and threshold ring signature method. The mechanism firstly judges whether a node is in a trusted domain based on the proposed Distributed Sub-domain Networking (DSN) method to reduce energy consumption and avoid single point failure. Then, it quantifies security value of the nodes in the trusted domain based on the proposed three-dimension security measurement method. Finally, it confirms authenticity of the nodes using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)-based threshold ring signature scheme.Simulation results show our proposed mechanism can distinguish all malicious nodes among trusted nodes, the loss rate of trusted nodes is reduced to less than 5% and the false report rate reduced to less than 10%.

  {"id":"luoBlockchainEnabledCredibility2022","abstract":"The credibility of information is known as a major cause of a wide range of issues, such as: altered product information in food supply chains; fake transactions on E-commerce platforms; lengthy claim settlement time in agricultural insurance; and costly borrowings in agricultural financing. For a more specific example in food supply chains, end customers want to check the product information, but either doubt the authenticity of information, or simply do not have access to the information. The reason is that upstream suppliers and downstream retailers are often reluctant to share data, fearing privacy loss or business secret leakage. The consequence is that regulatory departments may face enormous challenges to identify accurate contamination sources, if there is scarce information or falsely recorded information at any stage of the food supply chain. In this paper, we focus on four common scenarios demanding information credibility in the agricultural supply chain: product traceability, E-commerce platforms, agricultural insurance, and agricultural financing. We review some high-profile smart credibility applications with emphasis on how blockchain related technologies can provide the information credibility by examining extant issues and relevant frameworks.","author":[{"family":"Luo","given":"Qiqi"},{"family":"Liao","given":"Ruizhi"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jiawei"},{"family":"Ye","given":"Xinyu"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Shanquan"}],"citation-key":"luoBlockchainEnabledCredibility2022","container-title":"IEEE ACCESS","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3150306","ISSN":"2169-3536","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"page":"45759-45771","title":"Blockchain Enabled Credibility Applications: Extant Issues, Frameworks and Cases","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"maBlockchainDrivenTrustedData2021","abstract":"The development of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology has achieved remarkable results in recent years. A large number of sensors and machinery are connected, and combined with the Internet, to achieve intelligent management and operation. However, the traditional centralized IoT data management solution inevitably encounters challenges of data trust, security, sustainability, and user privacy is difficult to guarantee. This paper takes the intelligent transportation sensor network as an example and proposes a blockchain-based Internet of Vehicles (IoV) data secure sharing scheme (called IoVChain), which implements automatic registration, rapid authentication, and reliable sharing method of IoV data through smart contract. The smart contract performs homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proof processing on the sensitive part of the data, and this part exists in the form of ciphertext on the blockchain. We adopt PBFT consensus mechanism to ensure the consistency of the entire network ledger, and all the IoV data processing and usage procedure is stored in the Merkle-tree-based block, which cannot be tampered with. Compared with the centralized IoV data management solution, the IoVChain scheme avoids the risk of single point of failure, and keeps the IoV data credible, available, and tamper-resistant under the premise of privacy and security, so that the data can be traced when needed. We have implemented the IoVChain scheme based on the consortium blockchain for trusted and secure sharing of IoV data. Finally, analysis and evaluation show that the proposed IoVChain scheme is feasible, safe, and extensible for the secure sharing of IoV data.","author":[{"family":"Ma","given":"Zhaofeng"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Lingyun"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Weizhe"}],"citation-key":"maBlockchainDrivenTrustedData2021","container-title":"IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL","DOI":"10.1109/JSEN.2020.3046752","ISSN":"1530-437X","issue":"22","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,15]]},"page":"25472-25479","title":"Blockchain-Driven Trusted Data Sharing With Privacy Protection in IoT Sensor Network","type":"article-journal","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"macedoSecurityAspectsInternet2019","abstract":"Internet of Things (IoT) has gained increasing visibility among emerging technologies and undoubtedly changing our daily life. Its adoption is strengthened by the growth of connected devices (things) as shown in recent statistics. However, as the number of connected things grows, responsibility related to security aspects also needs to increase. For instance, cyberattacks might happen if simple authentication mechanisms are not implemented on IoT applications, or if access control mechanisms are weakly defined. Considering the relevance of the subject, we performed a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify and synthesize security issues in IoT discussed in scientific papers published within a period of 8 years. Our literature review focused on four main security aspects, namely authentication, access control, data protection, and trust. We believe that a study considering these topics has the potential to reveal important opportunities and trends related to IoT security. In particular, we aim to identify open issues and technological trends that might guide future studies in this field, thus providing useful material both to researchers and to managers and developers of IoT systems. In this paper, we describe the protocol adopted to perform the SLR and present the state-of-the-art on the field by describing the main techniques reported in the retrieved studies. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study to compile information on a comprehensive set of security aspects in IoT. Moreover, we discuss the placement, in terms of architectural tiers, for deploying security techniques, in an attempt to provide guidelines to help design decisions of security solution developers. We summarize our results showing security trends and research gaps that can be explored in future studies.","author":[{"family":"Macedo","given":"Evandro L.

  {"id":"maDataAuthenticityIntegrity2022","abstract":"Blockchain-based mobile edge computing (BMEC) solves the problem of limited computing resources of devices in the Internet of Things (IoT). However, there are some security threats in the blockchain environment, among which the attacks against consensus algorithms are particularly serious, such as double-spending attacks and long-range attacks. These attacks target the block proposal or validation process, which compromise the integrity of the BMEC by overwriting the correct block record with the wrong block record. In this article,we propose a scheme to solve the above problem by using the cooperative threshold signature and group management scheme to protect the block validity. The blockchain process of a single node is controlled in a group cooperative way, and each new block is regarded as a valid block only if it has a valid threshold signature for the group to which it belongs. Concretely, the system is initialized by a cooperative distributed key generation protocol, the device management protocol uses a resident node to ensure the security and efficiency of device join and leave, and the signature issuing protocol can tolerate a certain degree of exceptions of nodes within the group. We analyze the resistance ability of the scheme against consensus attacks, prove the security of the scheme, and analyze the computing and communication efficiency. Experimental evaluations on the protocols of the proposed scheme have been conducted on cloud virtual machines and embedded boards, including Raspberry Pi and UP2 Grove, which indicated that the scheme is efficient in practical scenarios.","author":[{"family":"Ma","given":"Tianchen"},{"family":"Du","given":"Bowen"},{"family":"Li","given":"Mianhong"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jiangfeng"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Yang"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Hongfei"}],"citation-key":"maDataAuthenticityIntegrity2022","container-title":"IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL","DOI":"10.1109/JSEN.2022.3163915","ISSN":"1530-437X","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,15]]},"page":"9967-9980","title":"Toward Data Authenticity and Integrity for Blockchain-Based Mobile Edge Computing","type":"article-journal","volume":"22"},

An overview of the alternatives for dealing with these problems is presented, highlighting the way they try to solve or mitigate them. This approach allows the development of complex systems in which there are agents that show very different behaviours and that are able to adapt to unforeseen changes in the environment. This makes it possible to simulate socio-technical or natural environments and observe their possible evolution without the ethical considerations involved in experimenting in real environments.","author":[{"family":"Maestro-Prieto","given":"Jose A."},{"family":"Rodriguez","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Casado","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Corchado","given":"Juan M."}],"citation-key":"maestro-prietoAgentOrganisationsIndependent2020","container-title":"ADCAIJ-ADVANCES IN DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING AND ARTIFICIAL IN℡LIGENCE JOURNAL","DOI":"10.14201/ADCAIJ2020945570","ISSN":"2255-2863","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"page":"55-70","title":"Agent organisations: from independent agents to virtual organisations and societies of agents","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"mafarjaAugmentedWhaleFeature2020","abstract":"Smart connected appliances expand the boundaries of the conventional Internet into the new Internet of Things (IoT). IoT started to hold a significant role in our life, and in several fields as in transportation, industry, smart homes, and cities. However, one of the critical issues is how to protect IoT environments and prevent intrusions. Attacks detection systems aim to identify malicious patterns and threats that cannot be detected by traditional security countermeasures. In literature, feature selection or dimensionality reduction has been profoundly studied and applied to the design of intrusion detection systems. In this paper, we present a novel wrapper feature selection approach based on augmented Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), which adopted in the context of IoT attacks detection and handles the high dimensionality of the problem. In our approach, we introduce the use of both V-shaped and S-shaped transfer functions into WOA and compare the superior variant with other well-known evolutionary optimizers. The experiments are conducted using N-BaIoT dataset; wherein, five datasets were sampled from the original dataset. The dataset represents real IoT traffic, which is drawn from the UCI repository. The experimental results show that WOA based on V-shaped transfer function combined with elitist tournament binarization method is superior over S-shaped transfer function and outperforms other well-regarded evolutionary optimizers based on the obtained average accuracy, fitness, number of features, running time and convergence curves. Hence, we can conclude that the proposed approach can be deployed in IoT intrusion detection systems.","author":[{"family":"Mafarja","given":"Majdi"},{"family":"Heidari","given":"Ali Asghar"},{"family":"Habib","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Faris","given":"Hossam"},{"family":"Thaher","given":"Thaer"},{"family":"Aljarah","given":"Ibrahim"}],"citation-key":"mafarjaAugmentedWhaleFeature2020","container-title":"Future Generation Computer Systems","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2020.05.020","ISSN":"0167-739X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"page":"18-40","title":"Augmented whale feature selection for IoT attacks: Structure, analysis and applications","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X19313561","volume":"112"},
  {"id":"mahajanEmergenceHealthcareBlockchain2022","abstract":"Since the last decade, cloud-based Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have achieved important consideration to facilitate remote access of patient medical records. The modern evolution of Healthcare 4.0 applying the Internet of Things (IoT) elements with cloud computing reforms to obtain remote medical services has grown the researcher's recognition with the perspective of the smart city. The Healthcare 4.0 standard has consists of different layers to perform medical operations like periodic data sensing, data storage, data sharing, and auditing. The delicate and private medical records of victims lead to numerous difficulties while defending them from hackers. Therefore saving, obtaining, and distributing the patient medical data on the remote storage requires safety attentions so that medical records should not be compromised by the authorized user's components of E-healthcare systems. To achieve secure medical data storage, sharing, and accessing in Cloud Service Provider (CSP), various cryptography algorithms have been designed so far. But these traditional resolutions disappointed to manage the trade-off among the provisions of EHR safety in terms of computational competence, user-side verification, service-side verification, security, and without the trusted third party. Blockchain-based security techniques achieved notable recognition due to the strength to give strong security provisions for medical records storage and sharing with the least computation forces. The blockchain made focused on bitcoin technology among the researchers. Employing the blockchain in healthcare systems has been of current interest. This paper aims to present a systematic study of different blockchain-based solutions for the smart healthcare 4.0 system. The recent blockchain-based security solutions have been reviewed first and, then we presented a research gap considering the various parameters. The outcome of this paper discusses the current research gaps, the challenges of implementing the blockchain-based secure healthcare system, and the future roadmap or solutions.","author":[{"family":"Mahajan","given":"Hemant B."}],"citation-key":"mahajanEmergenceHealthcareBlockchain2022","container-title":"WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS","DOI":"10.1007/s11277-022-09535-y","ISSN":"0929-6212","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,10]]},"page":"2425-2446","title":"Emergence of Healthcare 4.0 and Blockchain into Secure Cloud-based Electronic Health Records Systems: Solutions, Challenges, and Future Roadmap","type":"article-journal","volume":"126"},

These technologies assisted the early detection/diagnosis, trends analysis, intervention planning, healthcare burden forecasting, comorbidity analysis, and mitigation and control, to name a few. The key-enablers of these technologies was data that was obtained from heterogeneous sources (i.e., social networks (SN), internet of (medical) things (IoT/IoMT), cellular networks, transport usage, epidemiological investigations, and other digital/sensing platforms). To this end, we provide an insightful overview of the role of data-driven analytics leveraging AI in the era of COVID-19. Specifically, we discuss major services that AI can provide in the context of COVID-19 pandemic based on six grounds, (i) AI role in seven different epidemic containment strategies (a.k.a non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)), (ii) AI role in data life cycle phases employed to control pandemic via digital solutions, (iii) AI role in performing analytics on heterogeneous types of data stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, (iv) AI role in the healthcare sector in the context of COVID-19 pandemic, (v) general-purpose applications of AI in COVID-19 era, and (vi) AI role in drug design and repurposing (e.g., iteratively aligning protein spikes and applying three/four-fold symmetry to yield a low-resolution candidate template) against COVID-19. Further, we discuss the challenges involved in applying AI to the available data and privacy issues that can arise from personal data transitioning into cyberspace. We also provide a concise overview of other latest technologies that were increasingly applied to limit the spread of the ongoing pandemic.

  {"id":"majidApplicationsWirelessSensor2022","abstract":"The 21st century has seen rapid changes in technology, industry, and social patterns. Most industries have moved towards automation, and human intervention has decreased, which has led to a revolution in industries, named the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0). Industry 4.0 or the fourth industrial revolution (IR 4.0) relies heavily on the Internet of Things (IoT) and wireless sensor networks (WSN). IoT and WSN are used in various control systems, including environmental monitoring, home automation, and chemical/biological attack detection. IoT devices and applications are used to process extracted data from WSN devices and transmit them to remote locations. This systematic literature review offers a wide range of information on Industry 4.0, finds research gaps, and recommends future directions. Seven research questions are addressed in this article: (i) What are the contributions of WSN in IR 4.0? (ii) What are the contributions of IoT in IR 4.0? (iii) What are the types of WSN coverage areas for IR 4.0? (iv) What are the major types of network intruders in WSN and IoT systems? (v) What are the prominent network security attacks in WSN and IoT? (vi) What are the significant issues in IoT and WSN frameworks? and (vii) What are the limitations and research gaps in the existing work? This study mainly focuses on research solutions and new techniques to automate Industry 4.0. In this research, we analyzed over 130 articles from 2014 until 2021. This paper covers several aspects of Industry 4.0, from the designing phase to security needs, from the deployment stage to the classification of the network, the difficulties, challenges, and future directions.","author":[{"family":"Majid","given":"Mamoona"},{"family":"Habib","given":"Shaista"},{"family":"Javed","given":"Abdul Rehman"},{"family":"Rizwan","given":"Muhammad"},{"family":"Srivastava","given":"Gautam"},{"family":"Gadekallu","given":"Thippa Reddy"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Jerry Chun-Wei"}],"citation-key":"majidApplicationsWirelessSensor2022","container-title":"SENSORS","DOI":"10.3390/s22062087","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,3]]},"title":"Applications of Wireless Sensor Networks and Internet of Things Frameworks in the Industry Revolution 4.0: A Systematic Literature Review","type":"article-journal","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"makridakisBlockchainCurrentChallenges2019","abstract":"Blockchain is a new technology, often referred to as the Internet of Value. As with all new technologies, there is no consensus on its potential value, with some people claiming that it will bring more disruptive changes than the Internet and others contesting the extent of its importance. Despite predictions that the future is perilous, there is evidence that blockchain is a remarkable, new technology that will change the way transactions are made, based on its ability to guarantee trust among unknown actors, assure the immutability of records, while also making intermediaries obsolete. The importance of blockchain can be confirmed by the interest in digital currencies, the great number of published blockchain papers, as well as MDPI's journal Future Internet which exclusively publishes blockchain articles, including this special issue covering present and future blockchain challenges. This paper is a survey of the fast growing field of blockchain, discussing its advantages and possible drawbacks and their implications for the future of the Internet and our personal lives and societies in general. The paper consists of the following parts; the first provides a general introduction and discusses the disruptive changes initiated by blockchain, the second discusses the unique value of blockchain and its general characteristics, the third presents an overview of industries with the greatest potential for disruptive changes, the forth describes the four major blockchain applications with the highest prospective advantages, and the fifth part of the paper ends with a discussion on the most notable subset of innovative blockchain applications-Smart Contracts, DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) and super safe networks-and their future implications. There is also a concluding section, which summarizes the paper, describes the future of blockchain, and mentions the challenges to be overcome.","author":[{"family":"Makridakis","given":"Spyros"},{"family":"Christodoulou","given":"Klitos"}],"citation-key":"makridakisBlockchainCurrentChallenges2019","container-title":"FUTURE INTERNET","DOI":"10.3390/fi11120258","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12]]},"title":"Blockchain: Current Challenges and Future Prospects/Applications","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},

IoT devices, being resource constrained due to smaller size, are vulnerable to various security threats. Recently, many distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks generated with the help of IoT botnets affected the services of many websites. The destructive botnets need to be detected at the early stage of infection. Machine-learning models can be utilized for early detection of botnets. This paper proposes one-class classifier-based machine-learning solution for the detection of IoT botnets in a heterogeneous environment. The proposed one-class classifier, which is based on one-class KNN, can detect the IoT botnets at the early stage with high accuracy. The proposed machine-learning-based model is a lightweight solution that works by selecting the best features leveraging well-known filter and wrapper methods for feature selection. The proposed strategy is evaluated over different datasets collected from varying network scenarios. The experimental results reveal that the proposed technique shows improved performance, consistent across three different datasets used for evaluation.","author":[{"family":"Malik","given":"Kainat"},{"family":"Rehman","given":"Faisal"},{"family":"Maqsood","given":"Tahir"},{"family":"Mustafa","given":"Saad"},{"family":"Khalid","given":"Osman"},{"family":"Akhunzada","given":"Adnan"}],"citation-key":"malikLightweightInternetThings2022","container-title":"SENSORS","DOI":"10.3390/s22103646","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,5]]},"title":"Lightweight Internet of Things Botnet Detection Using One-Class Classification","type":"article-journal","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"masoumiCityDigitalTwins2023","abstract":"The emerging field of City Digital Twins has advanced in recent years with the help of digital infrastructure and technologies connected to the Internet of Things (IoT). However, the evolution of this field has been so fast that a gap has opened in relation to systematic reviews of the relevant literature and the maturation of City Digital Twins on an urban scale. Our work bridges this gap by highlighting maturity in the field. We conducted a systematic literature review with bibliometric and content analysis of 41 selected papers published in Web of Science and Scopus databases, covering five areas: data types and sources, case studies, applied technologies and methods, maturity spectrum, and applications. Based on maturity indicators, the majority of the reviewed studies (90%) were at initial to medium stages of maturity (up to element 3), most of them focused on 3D modelling, monitoring and visualisation. However, digital twins cannot be limited to 3D models, monitoring and visualisation, for they can be developed to include two-directional interactions between humans and computers. Such a high level of maturity, which was not found in the reviewed studies, requires advanced technologies and methods such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, BIM and GIS. We also found that further studies are essential if the field is to handle the complex urban challenges of multidisciplinary digital twins . While City Digital Twins extend by definition beyond mere 3D city modelling, some studies involving 3D city models still refer to their subjects as City Digital Twins. Among the research gaps we identified, we'd like to highlight the need for near-real-time data analytics algorithms, which could furnish City Digital Twins with big data insights. Other opportunities include public participation capabilities to increase social collaboration, integrating BIM and GIS technologies and improving storage and computation infrastructure.","author":[{"family":"Masoumi","given":"Homa"},{"family":"Shirowzhan","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Eskandarpour","given":"Paria"},{"family":"Pettit","given":"Christopher James"}],"citation-key":"masoumiCityDigitalTwins2023","container-title":"BIG EARTH DATA","DOI":"10.1080/20964471.2022.2160156","ISSN":"2096-4471","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,2]]},"page":"1-46","title":"City Digital Twins: their maturity level and differentiation from 3D city models","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},

The success of most UAV-based IoT applications is heavily dependent on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, for instance, computer vision and path planning. These AI methods must process data and provide decisions while ensuring low latency and low energy consumption. However, the existing cloud-based AI paradigm finds it difficult to meet these strict UAV requirements. Edge AI, which runs AI on-device or on edge servers close to users, can be suitable for improving UAV-based IoT services. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of the impact of edge AI on key UAV technical aspects (i.e., autonomous navigation, formation control, power management, security and privacy, computer vision, and communication) and applications (i.e., delivery systems, civil infrastructure inspection, precision agriculture, search and rescue (SAR) operations, acting as aerial wireless base stations (BSs), and drone light shows).

Ensuring cybersecurity in ITS is a complex task on which the safety and efficiency of transportation depends. The imposition of standards for a comprehensive architecture, as well as specific security standards, is one of the key steps in the evolution of ITS. The article examines the general outlines of the ITS architecture and security issues. The main focus of security approaches is: configuration and initialization of the devices during manufacturing at perception layer; anonymous authentication of nodes in VANET at network layer; defense of fog-based structures at support layer and description and standardization of the complex model of data and metadata and defense of systems, based on AI at application layer. The article oversees some conventional methods as network segmentation and cryptography that should be adapted in order to be applied in ITS cybersecurity. The focus is on innovative approaches that have recently been trying to find their place in ITS security strategies. These approaches includes blockchain, bloom filter, fog computing, artificial intelligence, game theory and ontologies.

However, with the challenging nature of IoT, new security breaches have been introduced, especially against the Routing Protocol for Low-power and Lossy Networks (RPL). Artificial-Intelligence-based technologies can be used to provide insights to deal with IoT's security issues. In this paper, we describe the initial stages of developing, a new Intrusion Detection System using Machine Learning (ML) to detect routing attacks against RPL. We first simulate the routing attacks and capture the traffic for different topologies. We then process the traffic and generate large 2-class and multi-class datasets. We select a set of significant features for each attack, and we use this set to train different classifiers to make the IDS. The experiments with 5-fold cross-validation demonstrated that decision tree (DT), random forests (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) achieved good results of more than 99% value for accuracy, precision, recall, and F 1 score metrics, and RF has achieved the lowest fitting time. On the other hand, Deep Learning (DL) model, MLP, Naive Bayes (NB), and Logistic Regression (LR) have shown significantly lower performance. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

  {"id":"mehtaBlockchainEnvisionedUAV2020","abstract":"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) or drones is a technology with a huge potential for proving different efficient solutions in the smart city. It has been mostly adopted by military, aviation, civil, and commercial sectors for audio and video surveillance. The communication and security challenges of UAV is well mentioned by researchers and organizations (defense) around the world, although many of the challenges remain unresolved (especially for sensitive and consumer-related applications). Moreover, the conventional network systems may not be very efficient in dealing with the dynamic requirements of UAVs. As the UAVs are generally deployed in tough environments and terrains, therefore it is quite essential to provide a strong and secure network. Motivated from these facts, this paper presents an extensive survey on security issues in 5G-enabled UAV networks as per the literature published till the fourth quarter of 2019. It also presents the taxonomy of existing security issues in 5G-enabled UAV networks. Based on the findings from the survey, we present a Blockchain (BC)-based security solution and a summary of research challenges in the integration of BC with 5G-enabled UAV. Then, we present a case study of implementing BC with UAVs to secure industrial applications.","author":[{"family":"Mehta","given":"Parimal"},{"family":"Gupta","given":"Rajesh"},{"family":"Tanwar","given":"Sudeep"}],"citation-key":"mehtaBlockchainEnvisionedUAV2020","container-title":"COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS","DOI":"10.1016/j.comcom.2020.01.023","ISSN":"0140-3664","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,1]]},"page":"518-538","title":"Blockchain envisioned UAV networks: Challenges, solutions, and comparisons","type":"article-journal","volume":"151"},

Technological advancements have increased its popularity, but concerns and risks related to IoT are growing considerably along with the increased number of connected devices. In 2013, a new cryptography-based infrastructure called blockchain emerged with the potential to replace the existing cloud-based infrastructure of IoT through decentralization. In this article, we provide a taxonomy of the challenges in the current IoT infrastructure, and a literature survey with a taxonomy of the issues to expect in the future of the IoT after adopting blockchain as an infrastructure. The two architectures are compared based on their strengths and weaknesses. Then a brief survey of ongoing key research activities in blockchain is presented, which will have considerable impact on overcoming the challenges encountered in the applicability of blockchain in IoT. Finally, considering the challenges and issues in both infrastructures and the latest research activities, we propose a high-level hybrid IoT approach that uses the cloud, edge/fog, and blockchain together to avoid the limitations of each infrastructure.","author":[{"family":"Memon","given":"Raheel Ahmed"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jian Ping"},{"family":"Ahmed","given":"Junaid"},{"family":"Nazeer","given":"Muhammad Irshad"},{"family":"Ismail","given":"Muhammad"},{"family":"Ali","given":"Khursheed"}],"citation-key":"memonCloudbasedVsBlockchainbased2020","container-title":"FRONTIERS OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING","DOI":"10.1631/FITEE.1800343","ISSN":"2095-9184","issue":"4, SI","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,4]]},"page":"563-586","title":"Cloud-based vs. blockchain-based IoT: a comparative survey and way forward","type":"article-journal","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"mershadLightweightBlockchainSolutions2023","abstract":"The proliferation of resource-constrained devices has become prevalent across various digital applications, including smart homes, smart healthcare, and smart transportation, among others. However, the integration of these devices brings many security issues. To address these concerns, Blockchain technology has been widely adopted due to its robust security characteris-tics, including immutability, cryptography, and distributed consensus. However, implementing blockchain within these networks is highly challenging due to the limited resources of the employed devices and the resource-intensive requirements of the blockchain. To overcome these challenges, a multitude of researchers have proposed lightweight blockchain solutions specifically designed for resource-constrained networks. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of lightweight blockchain solutions proposed in the literature. More precisely, we identify five areas within the “lightweight” concept, namely, blockchain architecture, device authentication, cryptography model, consensus algorithm, and storage method. We discuss the various methods employed in each “lightweight” category, highlighting existing gaps and identifying areas for improvement. Our review highlights the missing points in existing systems and paves the way to building a complete lightweight blockchain solution for networks of resource-constrained devices.","author":[{"family":"Mershad","given":"Khaleel"},{"family":"Cheikhrouhou","given":"Omar"}],"citation-key":"mershadLightweightBlockchainSolutions2023","container-title":"INTERNET OF THINGS","DOI":"10.1016/j.iot.2023.100984","ISSN":"2543-1536","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,12]]},"title":"Lightweight blockchain solutions: Taxonomy, research progress, and comprehensive review","type":"article-journal","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"mohdaliSystematicMappingExploring2023","abstract":"The Internet of Everything (IoE) represents a paradigm shift in the world of connectivity. While the Internet of Things (IoT) initiated the era of interconnected devices, the IoE takes this concept to new heights by interlinking objects, individuals, data, and processes. Symmetry in IoE innovation and technology is essential for creating a harmonious and efficient ecosystem to ensure that the benefits are accessible to a broad spectrum of society while minimizing potential drawbacks. This comprehensive review paper explores the multifaceted landscape of the IoE, delving into its core concepts, enabling technologies, real-world applications, and the intricate web of challenges it presents. A focal point of this review is the diverse array of real-world applications spanning healthcare, smart cities, industry 4.0, agriculture, and sustainability. Previous works and examples illustrate how the IoE reshapes these domains, leading to greater efficiency, sustainability, and improved decision making. However, the transformative power of the IoE is accompanied by a host of challenges, including security and privacy concerns, interoperability issues, and the ethical implications of ubiquitous connectivity. These challenges are dissected in order to comprehensively understand the obstacles and potential solutions in the IoE landscape. As we stand on the cusp of an IoE-driven future, this review paper serves as a valuable resource for researchers, policy makers, and industry professionals seeking to navigate the complexities of this emerging paradigm. By illuminating the intricacies of the IoE, this review fosters a deeper appreciation for the transformative potential and the multifaceted challenges that lie ahead in the Internet of Everything era.","author":[{"family":"Mohd Ali","given":"Fazlina"},{"family":"Md Yunus","given":"Nur Arzilawati"},{"family":"Mohamed","given":"Nur Nabila"},{"family":"Mat Daud","given":"Marizuana"},{"family":"A.

  {"id":"mohsanRoleDroneTechnology2022","abstract":"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by a new coronavirus, has affected economic and social standards as governments and healthcare regulatory agencies throughout the world expressed worry and explored harsh preventative measures to counteract the disease's spread and intensity. Several academics and experts are primarily concerned with halting the continuous spread of the unique virus. Social separation, the closing of borders, the avoidance of big gatherings, contactless transit, and quarantine are important methods. Multiple nations employ autonomous, digital, wireless, and other promising technologies to tackle this coronary pneumonia. This research examines a number of potential technologies, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, deep learning (DL), the Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing, and virtual reality (VR), in an effort to mitigate the danger of COVID-19. Due to their ability to transport food and medical supplies to a specific location, UAVs are currently being utilized as an innovative method to combat this illness. This research intends to examine the possibilities of UAVs in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic from several angles. UAVs offer intriguing options for delivering medical supplies, spraying disinfectants, broadcasting communications, conducting surveillance, inspecting, and screening patients for infection. This article examines the use of drones in healthcare as well as the advantages and disadvantages of strict adoption. Finally, challenges, opportunities, and future work are discussed to assist in adopting drone technology to tackle COVID-19-like diseases.","author":[{"family":"Mohsan","given":"Syed Agha Hassnain"},{"family":"Zahra","given":"Qurat ul Ain"},{"family":"Khan","given":"Muhammad Asghar"},{"family":"Alsharif","given":"Mohammed H."},{"family":"Elhaty","given":"Ismail A."},{"family":"Jahid","given":"Abu"}],"citation-key":"mohsanRoleDroneTechnology2022","container-title":"MICROMACHINES","DOI":"10.3390/mi13101593","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,10]]},"title":"Role of Drone Technology Helping in Alleviating the COVID-19 Pandemic","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

Though the capabilities of the business models are empowered with Internet driven service providers, they are vulnerable to severe security threats. Intrusion detection systems capable of identifying malicious attacks from traffic data are potential tools in securing organizational resources from unauthorized access. This paper proposes an intrusion detection system modeled as a two stage framework with feature selection performed by a Generalized Mean Grey Wolf Algorithm and an ElasticNet Contractive Auto Encoder. It is tested with the NSL-KDD and BoT-IoT datasets resulting in an overall classification accuracy of 0.999 for binary and multi-class classification of attacks. This system performs classification with an optimal subset of traffic features and surpasses the performances of state-of-the-art intrusion detection systems. Further, the proposed model also demonstrates its effectiveness to learn from unlabeled data without additional training, signal drifts from normal data and generalization with arbitrary test data.

  {"id":"mollahBlockchainInternetVehicles2021","abstract":"Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is an emerging concept that is believed to help realize the vision of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). IoV has become an important research area of impactful applications in recent years due to the rapid advancements in vehicular technologies, high throughput satellite communication, the Internet of Things, and cyber-physical systems. IoV enables the integration of smart vehicles with the Internet and system components attributing to their environments, such as public infrastructures, sensors, computing nodes, pedestrians, and other vehicles. By allowing the development of a common information exchange platform between vehicles and heterogeneous vehicular networks, this integration aims to create a better environment and public space for the people as well as to enhance safety for all road users. Being a participatory data exchange and storage, the underlying information exchange platform of IoV needs to be secure, transparent, and immutable in order to achieve the intended objectives of ITS. In this connection, the adoption of blockchain as a system platform for supporting the information exchange needs of IoV has been explored. Due to their decentralized and immutable nature, IoV applications enabled by blockchain are believed to have a number of desirable properties, such as decentralization, security, transparency, immutability, and automation. In this article, we present a contemporary survey on the latest advancement in blockchain for IoV. Particularly, we highlight the different application scenarios of IoV after carefully reviewing the recent literature. We also investigate several key challenges where blockchain is applied in IoV. Furthermore, we present the future opportunities and explore further research directions of IoV as a key enabler of ITS.","author":[{"family":"Mollah","given":"Muhammad Bauer"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Niyato","given":"Dusit"},{"family":"Guan","given":"Yong Liang"},{"family":"Yuen","given":"Chau"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Sumei"},{"family":"Lam","given":"Kwok-Yan"},{"family":"Koh","given":"Leong Hai"}],"citation-key":"mollahBlockchainInternetVehicles2021","container-title":"IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL","DOI":"10.1109/JIOT.2020.3028368","ISSN":"2327-4662","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,15]]},"page":"4157-4185","title":"Blockchain for the Internet of Vehicles Towards Intelligent Transportation Systems: A Survey","type":"article-journal","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"moreiradonascimentoDecentralizedFederatedLearning2022","abstract":"Internet of Things-based systems are typically distributed systems and thus inherit all issues related to the need to guarantee confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Moreover, IoT-based systems are vulnerable to several attacks, mainly due to the weakness of IoT devices, which have little computational and memory power, necessary for more sophisticated security features. To build robust infrastructures, one of the traditional strategies to deal with these problems involves intrusion detection and prevention techniques. Implementing them in a centralized way is usual, which leads to not being scalable for IoT systems with an increasing number of devices. Moreover, it implies an unacceptable single point of failure. Besides, sending all collected data to a centralized server in the cloud poses a significant risk to the privacy of information. Recently, machine learning techniques, as decentralized federated learning, combined with distributed ledger technologies, have been used to implement more robust and privacy-preserving intrusion detection systems for IoT-based systems. However most current decentralized federated learning approaches depend on a centralized server, and so have a single point of failure. The centralized server is used to aggregate the local trained models obtained by means of deep learning algorithms performed on edge and fog devices. This paper reviews state of the art on intrusion detection based on totally decentralized federated learning and distributed ledger techniques applied to minimize IoT security threats, identifies open problems, and recommends future research directions to cope with them.","author":[{"family":"Moreira Do Nascimento","given":"Francisco Assis"},{"family":"Hessel","given":"Fabiano"}],"citation-key":"moreiradonascimentoDecentralizedFederatedLearning2022","container-title":"2022 IEEE 8TH WORLD FORUM ON INTERNET OF THINGS, WF-IOT","DOI":"10.1109/WF-IOT54382.2022.10152174","ISBN":"978-1-66549-153-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"publisher":"IEEE; Multi Soc IEEE IoT Initiat; IEEE Commun Soc; IEEE Council Elect Design Automat; IEEE Circuits & Syst Soc; IEEE Reliabil Soc; IEEE Signal Proc Soc; CSS; EDS; IES; IEEE Microwave Theory & Technol Soc; IEEE Power & Energy Soc; IEEE Power Elect Soc; IEEE Solid State Circuits Soc; IEEE Japan Council; KIOXIA; NTT; RakutenMobile; Toshiba Digital Solut Corp; EAGLYS","title":"Decentralized Federated Learning for Intrusion Detection in IoT-based Systems: A Review","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"motylinskiGPUbasedMachineLearning2022","abstract":"Rapid development and adaptation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has created new problems for secur-ing these interconnected devices and networks. There are hundreds of thousands of IoT devices with underlying security vulnerabilities, such as insufficient device authentication/authorisation making them vulnerable to malware infection. IoT botnets are designed to grow and compete with one another over unsecure devices and networks. Once infected, the device will monitor a Command-and-Control (C&C) server indicating the target of an attack via Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. These security issues, coupled with the continued growth of IoT, presents a much larger attack surface for attackers to exploit in their attempts to disrupt or gain unauthorized access to networks, systems, and data. Large datasets available online provide good benchmarks for the development of accurate solutions for botnet detection, however model training is often a time-consuming process. Interestingly, significant advance-ment of GPU technology allows shortening the time required to train such large and complex models. This paper presents a methodology for the pre-processing of the IoT-Bot dataset and classification of various attack types included. We include descriptions of pre-processing actions conducted to prepare data for training and a comparison of results achieved with GPU accelerated versions of Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbour, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression classifiers from the cuML library. Using our methodology, the best-trained models achieved at least 0.99 scores for accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score. Moreover, the application of feature selection and training models on GPU significantly reduced the training and estimation times.(c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

  {"id":"mozumderMetaverseDigitalAntiAging2023","abstract":"Metaverse is the buzz technology of the moment raising attention both from academia and industry. Many stakeholders are considering an extension of their existing applications into the metaverse environment for more usability. The healthcare industry is gradually making use of the metaverse to improve quality of service and enhance living conditions. In this paper, we focus on the potential of digital anti-aging healthcare in the metaverse environment. We show how we can use metaverse environment to enhance healthcare service quality and increase the life expectancy of patients through more confident processes, such as chronic disease management, fitness, and mental health control, in the metaverse. The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain (BC), Internet of Things (IoT), immersive technologies, and digital twin in the metaverse environment presents new scopes for the healthcare industry. By leveraging these technologies, healthcare providers can improve patient outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and create new healthcare experiences for a better life, thus facilitating the anti-aging process. AI can be used to analyze large-scale medical data and make personalized treatment plans, while blockchain can create a secure and transparent healthcare data ecosystem. As for IoT devices, they collect real-time data from patients, which is necessary for treatment. Together, these technologies can transform the healthcare industry and improve the lives of patients worldwide. The suggestions highlighted in this paper are worthy to undergo implementation and create more benefits that will promote a digital anti-aging process for its users for a longer life experience.","author":[{"family":"Mozumder","given":"Md Ariful Islam"},{"family":"Armand","given":"Tagne Poupi Theodore"},{"family":"Uddin","given":"Shah Muhammad Imtiyaj"},{"family":"Athar","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Sumon","given":"Rashedul Islam"},{"family":"Hussain","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Hee-Cheol"}],"citation-key":"mozumderMetaverseDigitalAntiAging2023","container-title":"APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL","DOI":"10.3390/app13085127","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,4]]},"title":"Metaverse for Digital Anti-Aging Healthcare: An Overview of Potential Use Cases Based on Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, IoT Technologies, Its Challenges, and Future Directions","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

Traditional security practices of authentication and authorization have been initially designed for security needs of centralized client/server models which are good to deal with human-machine interaction over the Internet. In centralized systems, normally devices and users are trusted for being in the same application domain. Moreover, such systems can become a bottleneck for a number of queries at the same time; or may become a single point of failure causing unavailability of connected devices that are totally relying on a single trusted party. This paper explores the IoT security issues and concerns. Moreover, it provides a review of centralized and decentralized IoT security solutions in terms of authentication and authorization. Additionally, it discusses how Blockchain technology can be leveraged to provide IoT security.","author":[{"family":"Muzammal","given":"Syeda Mariam"},{"family":"Murugesan","given":"Raja Kumar"}],"citation-key":"muzammalStudySecuredAuthentication2020","collection-title":"Communications in Computer and Information Science","container-title":"ADVANCES IN CYBER SECURITY (ACES 2019)","DOI":"10.1007/978-981-15-2693-0_2","editor":[{"family":"Anbar","given":"M"},{"family":"Abdullah","given":"N"},{"family":"Manickam","given":"S"}],"ISBN":"978-981-15-2693-0; 978-981-15-2692-3","ISSN":"1865-0929","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"page":"18-32","publisher":"Univ Sains Malaysia, Natl Adv IPv6 Ctr","title":"A Study on Secured Authentication and Authorization in Internet of Things: Potential of Blockchain Technology","type":"paper-conference","volume":"1132"},

  {"id":"namaneBlockchainBasedAccessControl2022","abstract":"The Internet of Things is gaining more importance in the present era of Internet technology. It is considered as one of the most important technologies of everyday life. Moreover, IoT systems are ceaselessly growing with more and more devices. They are scalable, dynamic, and distributed, hence the origin of the crucial security requirements in IoT. One of the most challenging issues that the IoT community must handle recently is how to ensure an access control approach that manages the security requirements of such a system. Traditional access control technologies are not suitable for a large-scale and distributed network structure. Most of them are based on a centralized approach, where the use of a trusted third party (TTP) is obligatory. Furthermore, the emergence of blockchain technology has allowed researchers to come up with a solution for these security issues. This technology is highly used to record access control data. Additionally, it has great potential for managing access control requests. This paper proposed a blockchain-based access control taxonomy according to the access control nature: partially decentralized and fully decentralized. Furthermore, it presents an overview of blockchain-based access control solutions proposed in different IoT applications. Finally, the article analyzes the proposed works according to certain criteria that the authors deem important.","author":[{"family":"Namane","given":"Sarra"},{"family":"Ben Dhaou","given":"Imed"}],"citation-key":"namaneBlockchainBasedAccessControl2022","container-title":"ELECTRONICS","DOI":"10.3390/electronics11142225","issue":"14","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,7]]},"title":"Blockchain-Based Access Control Techniques for IoT Applications","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"nigamIntegrationBlockchainIoT2022","abstract":"Growth of IoT (Internet of Things) has proved its importance in the various sector. But due to some limitations of security, privacy, etc. it is not possible to use IoT devices in the field of agriculture at its fullest. To overcome these limitations Blockchain is used as it provides security, privacy and it helps in monitoring, examining, to authenticate the agriculture data. With the help of Blockchain, traditional methods of collection, rearranging and distribution of Agri-products can be replaced by more trust-worthy, decentralized, vitreous, and immutable style. In agriculture sector, Blockchain and Internet of things can be amalgamated to have better results which leads us to one level up in the field of agriculture and may control or improve the supply chain in proper manner. The consequences of using blockchain and IoT in combination will result in better understanding to supervise and managing the agriculture effectively. This chapter will illustrate the importance of using blockchain and IoT collectively to develop smart agriculture from traditional agriculture. A model is also proposed to overcome the challenges encountered in agriculture sector, based on IoT applications with the help of blockchain. Also, a review is mentioned about the main characteristics and functions of blockchain used in agriculture sector such as livestock grazing, crops and food supply chain. Finally, some of the open issues Blockchain and security challenges are elaborate.","author":[{"family":"Nigam","given":"Swati"},{"family":"Sugandh","given":"Urvashi"},{"family":"Khari","given":"Manju"}],"citation-key":"nigamIntegrationBlockchainIoT2022","collection-title":"Advances in Computers","container-title":"EDGE/FOG COMPUTING PARADIGM: THE CONCEPT PLATFORMS AND APPLICATIONS, VOL. 127","DOI":"10.1016/bs.adcom.2022.02.015","editor":[{"family":"Raj","given":"P"},{"family":"Saini","given":"K"},{"family":"Surianarayanan","given":"C"}],"ISBN":"978-0-12-824506-4","ISSN":"0065-2458","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"page":"507-537","title":"The integration of blockchain and IoT edge devices for smart agriculture: Challenges and use cases","type":"chapter","volume":"127"},

  {"id":"noamanChallengesIntegrationHeterogeneous2022","abstract":"Internet of Things (IoT) is considered the upcoming industrial and academic revolution in the technological world having billions of things and devices connected to the Internet. These connected devices are heterogeneous. They have different standards and technologies which communicate through different protocols. Therefore, the implementation of IoT on a large scale is difficult due to these heterogeneity challenges. This motivated us to overcome the scaling problem of IoT by identifying the challenges from the literature and providing solutions. This study is based on the identification of the heterogeneous challenges with solutions via a systematic literature review. A total of 81 primary sources were selected. After extracting and synthesizing the data, we identified 14 different IoT heterogeneity challenges. Some of the identified challenges are “heterogeneity of devices,” “heterogeneity in formats of data,” “heterogeneity in communication,” and “interoperability issue due to heterogeneity.” The identified challenges have been analyzed from digital libraries and timeframe perspectives. Furthermore, we have found a total of 81 solutions for those challenges, with at least 5 unique solutions for each challenge. In the future, we will categorize the challenges and prioritize the solutions by using a multi-criteria decision-making problem.","author":[{"family":"Noaman","given":"Muhammad"},{"family":"Khan","given":"Muhammad Sohail"},{"family":"Abrar","given":"Muhammad Faisal"},{"family":"Ali","given":"Sikandar"},{"family":"Alvi","given":"Atif"},{"family":"Saleem","given":"Muhammad Asif"}],"citation-key":"noamanChallengesIntegrationHeterogeneous2022","container-title":"SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING","DOI":"10.1155/2022/8626882","ISSN":"1058-9244","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,16]]},"title":"Challenges in Integration of Heterogeneous Internet of Things","type":"article-journal","volume":"2022"},

Due to the rapid growth of the Internet of Things technology, the number of vulnerable devices that become a part of a botnet has grown signiﬁcantly. The detection of such malicious trafﬁc is essential for taking timely countermeasures. While the idea of anomaly-based attack detection is not new and has been extensively studied, much less attention has been paid to dimensionality reduction in learning models induced for IoT networks. In this paper, we showed that it is possible to induce high accurate unsupervised learning models with reduced feature set sizes, which enables to decrease the required computational resources. Training one common model for all IoT devices, instead of dedicated model for each device, is another design option that is evaluated for resource optimization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Nomm","given":"Sven"},{"family":"Bahsi","given":"Hayretdin"}],"citation-key":"nommUnsupervisedAnomalyBased2018","container-title":"2018 17th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA)","DOI":"10.1109/ICMLA.2018.00171","event-place":"Orlando, FL","event-title":"2018 17th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA)","ISBN":"978-1-5386-6805-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,12]]},"language":"en","page":"1048-1053","publisher":"IEEE","publisher-place":"Orlando, FL","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Unsupervised Anomaly Based Botnet Detection in IoT Networks","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8614196/"},

  {"id":"nourReviewBlockchainPotential2022","abstract":"Blockchain technology applications in the electricity sector are getting considerable attention from both academia and industry. It is expected that blockchain will play an important role in the transition to the smart grid. The blockchain applications in the electricity sector can be classified to optimizing existing processes like metering and billing or grid management and using blockchain for emerging applications such as creating new platforms for value exchange like peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading. This paper briefly introduces the fundamentals of blockchain technology, such as different types of blockchain networks and consensus mechanisms, in addition to introducing a few blockchain platforms that are widely used in current studies, projects, and startups or may have future potential in the electricity sector applications. The contribution of this paper is to provide a review of potential applications of blockchain in many electricity sector use cases, and they are categorized into eight categories such as P2P energy trading, wholesale markets, retail markets, metering and billing, trading of renewable energy certificates (RECs) and carbon credits, electric mobility, enhancement of power system cyber security, investments in renewable energy sources (RESs), and power system operation and management. Moreover, examples of research studies, pilot projects, industrial projects, startups, or companies investigating the blockchain capabilities at each potential application are introduced. Furthermore, the studies presented in each use case are compared to clarify and highlight the blockchain functions and involved actors. Finally, the paper discusses the challenges that blockchain technology is facing that obstruct large-scale adoption in different sectors and in the electricity sector specifically and potential solutions to these challenges that are being developed.","author":[{"family":"Nour","given":"Morsy"},{"family":"Chaves-Avila","given":"Jose Pablo"},{"family":"Sanchez-Miralles","given":"Alvaro"}],"citation-key":"nourReviewBlockchainPotential2022","container-title":"IEEE ACCESS","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3171227","ISSN":"2169-3536","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"page":"47384-47418","title":"Review of Blockchain Potential Applications in the Electricity Sector and Challenges for Large Scale Adoption","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"ozerLightweightIntrusionDetection2021","abstract":"Intrusion detection systems play a vital role in traffic flow monitoring on Internet of Things networks by providing a secure network traffic environment and blocking unwanted traffic packets. Various intrusion detection systems approaches have been proposed previously based on data mining, fuzzy techniques, genetic, neurogenetic, particle swarm intelligence, rough sets, and conventional machine learning. However, these methods are not energy efficient and do not perform accurately due to the inappropriate feature selection or the use of full features of datasets. In general, datasets contain more than 10 features. Any machine learning-based lightweight intrusion detection systems trained with full features turn into an inefficient and heavyweight intrusion detection systems. This case challenges Internet of Things networks that suffer from power efficiency problems. Therefore, lightweight (energy-efficient), accurate, and high-performance intrusion detection systems are paramount instead of inefficient and heavyweight intrusion detection systems. To address these challenges, a new approach that can help to determine the most effective and optimal feature pairs of datasets which enable the development of lightweight intrusion detection systems was proposed. For this purpose, 10 machine learning algorithms and the recent BoT-IoT (2018) dataset were selected. Twelve best features recommended by the developers of this dataset were used in this study. Sixty-six unique feature pairs were generated from the 12 best features. Next, 10 full-feature-based intrusion detection systems were developed by training the 10 machine learning algorithms with the 12 full features. Similarly, 660 feature-pair-based lightweight intrusion detection systems were developed by training the 10 machine learning algorithms via each feature pair out of the 66 feature pairs. Moreover, the 10 intrusion detection systems trained with 12 best features and the 660 intrusion detection systems trained via 66 feature pairs were compared to each other based on the machine learning algorithmic groups. Then, the feature-pair-based lightweight intrusion detection systems that achieved the accuracy level of the 10 full-feature-based intrusion detection systems were selected. This way, the optimal and efficient feature pairs and the lightweight intrusion detection systems were determined. The most lightweight intrusion detection systems achieved more than 90% detection accuracy.","author":[{"family":"Ozer","given":"Erman"},{"family":"Iskefiyeli","given":"Murat"},{"family":"Azimjonov","given":"Jahongir"}],"citation-key":"ozerLightweightIntrusionDetection2021","container-title":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS","DOI":"10.1177/15501477211052202","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,10]]},"title":"Toward lightweight intrusion detection systems using the optimal and efficient feature pairs of the Bot-IoT 2018 dataset","type":"article-journal","volume":"17"},

  {"id":"padhiQuantumBiotechInternet2021","abstract":"Quantumization, the process of converting information into quantum (qubit) format, is a key enabler for propelling a new and distinct infrastructure in the pharmaceutical space. Quantum messenger RNA (QmRNA) technology, an indispensable constituent of quantum biotech (QB), is a compelling alternative to conventional vaccine methods because of its capacity for rapid development, high efficacy, and low-cost manufacturing to combat infectious diseases. Internet of Virus Things (IoVT), a biological version of Internet of Things (IoT), comprises applications to fight against pandemics and provides effective vaccine administration. The integration of QB and IoVT constitutes the QBIoVT system to advance the prospect of QmRNA vaccine discovery within a few days. This research disseminates the QBIoVT system paradigm, including architectural aspects, priority areas, challenges, applications, and QmRNA research engine design to accelerate QmRNA vaccines discovery. A comprehensive review of the literature was accomplished, and a context-centered methodology was applied to the QBIoVT paradigm forensic investigations to impel QmRNA vaccine discovery. Based on the above rumination, the principal motive for this study was to develop a novel QBIoVT theoretical framework which has not been produced through earlier theories. The proposed framework shall inspire future QBIoVT system research activities to improve pandemics detection and protection.","author":[{"family":"Padhi","given":"Prafulla Kumar"},{"family":"Charrua-Santos","given":"Feranando"}],"citation-key":"padhiQuantumBiotechInternet2021","container-title":"APPLIED SYSTEM INNOVATION","DOI":"10.3390/asi4020027","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6]]},"title":"Quantum Biotech and Internet of Virus Things: Towards a Theoretical Framework","type":"article-journal","volume":"4"},
  {"id":"padmashreeDecisionTreePearson2022","abstract":"The industrial revolution in recent years made massive uses of Internet of Things (IoT) applications like smart cities’ growth. This leads to automation in real-time applications to make human life easier. These IoT-en-abled applications, technologies, and communications enhance the quality of life, quality of service, people’s well-being, and operational efficiency. The efficiency of these smart devices may harm the end-users, misuse their sensitive information increase cyber-attacks and threats. This smart city expansion is difficult due to cyber attacks. Consequently, it is needed to develop an efficient system model that can protect IoT devices from attacks and threats. To enhance product safety and security, the IoT-enabled applications should be monitored in real-time. This paper proposed an efficient feature selection with a feature fusion technique for the detection of intruders in IoT. The input IoT data is subjected to preprocessing to enhance the data. From the preprocessed data, the higher-order statistical features are selected using the proposed Decision tree-based Pearson Correlation Recursive Feature Elimination (DT-PCRFE) model. This method efficiently eliminates the redundant and uncorrelated features which will increase resource utilization and reduces the time complexity of the system. Then, the request from IoT devices is converted into word embedding using the feature fusion model to enhance the system robustness. Finally, a Deep Neural network (DNN) has been used to detect malicious attacks with the selected features. This proposed model experiments with the BoT-IoT dataset and the result shows the proposed model efficiency which outperforms other existing models with the accuracy of 99.2%. © 2022, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

  {"id":"pajoohBlockchain6GEnabledIoT2022","abstract":"Ubiquitous computing turns into a reality with the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) adopted to connect massive numbers of smart and autonomous devices for various applications. 6G-enabled IoT technology provides a platform for information collection and processing at high speed and with low latency. However, there are still issues that need to be addressed in an extended connectivity environment, particularly the security and privacy domain challenges. In addition, the traditional centralized architecture is often unable to address problems associated with access control management, interoperability of different devices, the possible existence of a single point of failure, and extensive computational overhead. Considering the evolution of decentralized access control mechanisms, it is necessary to provide robust security and privacy in various IoT-enabled industrial applications. The emergence of blockchain technology has changed the way information is shared. Blockchain can establish trust in a secure and distributed platform while eliminating the need for third-party authorities. We believe the coalition of 6G-enabled IoT and blockchain can potentially address many problems.

  {"id":"pandeySecurityThreatsMitigation2022","abstract":"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been instrumental in enabling many new applications and services, including military and rescue operations, aerial surveillance, civilian applications, precision farming, as well as providing extensive wireless network access in remote areas. They have also been used in other areas such as transmission line and oil rig monitoring, disaster recovery, etc. With their increasing payload ability and flight duration, using UAVs is a preferred choice for a multitude of upcoming wireless communication systems. However, because of their open operational nature, UAVs are highly vulnerable to severe security breaches via cyber attacks, eavesdropping on navigational and communication links, etc. Given their widespread applications, the requirement of secured UAV communications has become more and more critical since security failures can lead to detrimental consequences. Several works have examined the extent of privacy and security issues in UAV-assisted networks and introduced various mitigation techniques to address different security challenges. In this paper, a comprehensive survey is conducted that centers on the security issues related to UAV-aided networks. A descriptive taxonomy of various security intrusions on the UAV networks and commonly-used secrecy performance metrics are thoroughly reviewed. An in-depth discussion is provided on alleviating threats with proactive security techniques blended with key wireless communication technologies such as mmWave, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), and cognitive radio. Moreover, several emerging topics like machine learning, software-defined networks, fog and edge computing, blockchain, are discussed in the context of UAV-aided secure communications.","author":[{"family":"Pandey","given":"Gaurav Kumar"},{"family":"Gurjar","given":"Devendra Singh"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Ha H."},{"family":"Yadav","given":"Suneel"}],"citation-key":"pandeySecurityThreatsMitigation2022","container-title":"IEEE ACCESS","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3215975","ISSN":"2169-3536","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"page":"112858-112897","title":"Security Threats and Mitigation Techniques in UAV Communications: A Comprehensive Survey","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"parkerDEMISeInterpretableDeep2019","abstract":"Recent studies have proposed that traditional security technology - involving pattern-matching algorithms that check predefined pattern sets of intrusion signatures - should be replaced with sophisticated adaptive approaches that combine machine learning and behavioural analytics. However, machine learning is performance driven, and the high computational cost is incompatible with the limited computing power, memory capacity and energy resources of portable IoT-enabled devices. The convoluted nature of deep-structured machine learning means that such models also lack transparency and interpretability. The knowledge obtained by interpretable learners is critical in security software design. We therefore propose two novel models featuring a common Deep Extraction and Mutual Information Selection (DEMISe) element which extracts features using a deep-structured stacked autoencoder, prior to feature selection based on the amount of mutual information (MI) shared between each feature and the class label. An entropy -based tree wrapper is used to optimise the feature subsets identified by the DEMISe element, yielding the DEMISe with Tree Evaluation and Regression Detection (DETEReD) model. This affords `white box' insight, and achieves a time to build of 603 seconds, a 99.07% detection rate, and 98.04% model accuracy. When tested against AWID, the best-referenced intrusion detection dataset, the new models achieved a test error comparable to or better than state-of-the-art machine-learning models, with a lower computational cost and higher levels of transparency and interpretability.","author":[{"family":"Parker","given":"Luke R."},{"family":"Yoo","given":"Paul D."},{"family":"Asyhari","given":"Taufiq A."},{"family":"Chermak","given":"Lounis"},{"family":"Jhi","given":"Yoonchan"},{"family":"Taha","given":"Kamal"}],"citation-key":"parkerDEMISeInterpretableDeep2019","container-title":"14TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AVAILABILITY, RELIABILITY AND SECURITY (ARES 2019)","DOI":"10.1145/3339252.3340497","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"title":"DEMISe: Interpretable Deep Extraction and Mutual Information Selection Techniques for IoT Intrusion Detection","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"parthibanEffectiveResourceScheduling2022","abstract":"The Modern Healthcare System (MHS) has become a revolutionized domain over the past decade and has extemporized from version 1.0 to 4.0 with an amalgamation of IoT and its allied technologies. The record sustaining in the MHS is the superlative task in Healthcare 4.0 and the need for maintaining the integrity and resource availability congregate challenges like cyber attacks, lack of resources, etc. However, these challenges can be subdued through augmented resource sharing and blockchain technology. Blockchain technology has proven to be more promising in preserving data security and maintaining the integrity of sensitive data. The conventional healthcare system is slowly cruising towards the modern healthcare domain for the ease of process by the users and for adopting rapid sharing and accessing of healthcare data by the authorized users. Cloud computing offers a major role in modernizing the conventional healthcare system as the patient's sensitive data were shared and stored in the cloud resources so that to access across the world. Even with the preoccupation of technology like cloud computing, there exists certain challenge like resource availability and data security and to address the aforementioned challenges this paper introduces an integrated model of Hybrid Gradient Decent Cuckoo Search (HGDCS) algorithm for effective resource sharing and Blockchain technology for affording inherent security and high level of integrity for the sensitive data.Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

  {"id":"patelAdoptionFederatedLearning2022","abstract":"The smart healthcare system has improved the patients quality of life (QoL), where the records are being analyzed remotely by distributed stakeholders. It requires a voluminous exchange of data for disease prediction via the open communication channel, i.e., the Internet to train artificial intelligence (AI) models efficiently and effectively. The open nature of communication channels puts data privacy at high risk and affects the model training of collected data at centralized servers. To overcome this, an emerging concept, i.e., federated learning (FL) is a viable solution. It performs training at client nodes and aggregates their results to train the global model. The concept of local training preserves the privacy, confidentiality, and integrity of the patient's data which contributes effectively to the training process. The applicability of FL in the healthcare domain has various advantages, but it has not been explored to its extent. The existing surveys majorly focused on the role of FL in diverse applications, but there exists no detailed or comprehensive survey on FL in healthcare informatics (HI). We present a relative comparison of recent surveys with the proposed survey. To strengthen healthcare data privacy and increase the QoL of patients, we proposed an FL-based layered healthcare informatics architecture along with the case study on FL-based electronic health records (FL-EHR). We discuss the emerging FL models, and present the statistical and security challenges in FL adoption in medical setups. Thus, the review presents useful insights for both academia and healthcare practitioners to investigate FL application in HI ecosystems.","author":[{"family":"Patel","given":"Vishwa Amitkumar"},{"family":"Bhattacharya","given":"Pronaya"},{"family":"Tanwar","given":"Sudeep"},{"family":"Gupta","given":"Rajesh"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Gulshan"},{"family":"Bokoro","given":"Pitshou N."},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Ravi"}],"citation-key":"patelAdoptionFederatedLearning2022","container-title":"IEEE ACCESS","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3201876","ISSN":"2169-3536","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"page":"90792-90826","title":"Adoption of Federated Learning for Healthcare Informatics: Emerging Applications and Future Directions","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"patelBlockchainTechnologyFood2023","abstract":"Livestock products share more than fifteen percent of total agri-foods traded worldwide. A global increase in food demand has increased the risk to food safety. Improvements in food quality, cold chain transit, and preservation are required for safe livestock products. Though, the food safety and regulation authorities demand complete food traceability from farm to fork, but in traditional supply chain it is ignored by fiddling with the transit paperwork and bill invoices. The process of supply chain reformation and activities linked to food recalls during food safety issues are insanely expensive and challenging. Traceability-driven food supply chain management is likely to implement novel technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT). The capability of the Blockchain era within the food sector is emerging with use cases across different regions, as shown via the growing number of studies. Credibility, efficiency, and safety are all improved when food products can be instantly traced from their point of origin through all points of contact on their way to the consumer. Blockchain assures a tamper-proof and transparent system that allows an innovative business solution, together with smart contracts. However, there are significant difficulties with the implementation of blockchain technology for food traceability. It necessitates more and more training platforms as well as trainers, who can make understanding and operability of this technology easy among ground-level participants and food entities. For the tactical application of this technology, it is essential to comprehend the legal and regulatory framework.","author":[{"family":"Patel","given":"A. S."},{"family":"Brahmbhatt","given":"M.

Its practical implementation came into existence a few years back. Since the advent of IoT, it has tackled many challenges such as management, tracking, observation, etc. It has contributed to various fields such as Healthcare 4.0, smart grid, smart agriculture, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), smart cities, smart homes, smart cars, and many more. It has applications through almost all domains, but the question arises: the performance evaluating parameters about specific IoT applications to consider to detect flaws in it. As per literature, there exist no such article helps beginners in selecting performance evaluation parameters for IoT-enabled applications. Motivated from the aforementioned facts, this paper presents a survey on performance evaluation metrics' systematic study for various IoT applications. We then graphically present the comparison of multiple parameters of domains security, energy efficiency, data storage, and network performance. From the analysis, we can infer that, in the smart city, latency is the most usable parameter, i.e., 77%. In contrast, in Healthcare 4.0, equal importance is given to latency and network bandwidth, which is 50%. Also, in Industry 4.0, scalability is the most opted performance parameter by the researchers, which is 100%.

  {"id":"pavlouTroubledJourneyQoS2018","abstract":"Network Quality of Service (QoS) and the associated user Quality of Experience (QoE) have always been the networking “holy grail” and have been sought after through various different approaches and networking technologies over the last decades. Despite substantial amounts of effort invested in the area, there has been very little actual deployment of mechanisms to guarantee QoS in the Internet. As a result, the Internet is largely operating on a “best effort” basis in terms of QoS. Here, we attempt a historical overview in order to better understand how we got to the point where we are today and consider the evolution of QoS/QoE in the future. As we move towards more demanding networking environments where enormous amounts of data is produced at the edge of the network (e.g., from IoT devices), computation will also need to migrate to the edge in order to guarantee QoS. In turn, we argue that distributed computing at the edge of the network will inevitably require infrastructure decentralisation. That said, trust to the infrastructure provider is more difficult to guarantee and new components need to be incorporated into the Internet landscape in order to be able to support emerging applications, but also achieve acceptable service quality. We start from the first steps of ATM and related IP-based technologies, we consider recent proposals for content-oriented and Information-Centric Networking, mobile edge and fog computing, and finally we see how distributed Internet governance through Distributed Ledger Technology and blockchains can influence QoS in future networks.","author":[{"family":"Pavlou","given":"George"},{"family":"Psaras","given":"Ioannis"}],"citation-key":"pavlouTroubledJourneyQoS2018","container-title":"COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS","DOI":"10.1016/j.comcom.2018.07.006","ISSN":"0140-3664","issue":"SI","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,10]]},"page":"8-12","title":"The troubled journey of QoS: From ATM to content networking, edge computing and distributed internet governance","type":"article-journal","volume":"131"},

  {"id":"pengPrivacyPreservationPermissionless2021","abstract":"Permissionless blockchain, as a kind of distributed ledger, has gained considerable attention because of its openness, transparency, decentralization, and immutability. Currently, permissionless blockchain has shown a good application prospect in many fields, from the initial cryptocurrency to the Internet of Things (IoT) and Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networking (VANET), which is considered as the beginning of rewriting our digital infrastructure. However, blockchain confronts some privacy risks that hinder its practical applications. Though numerous surveys reviewed the privacy preservation in blockchain, they failed to reveal the latest advances, nor have they been able to conduct a unified standard comprehensive classification of the privacy protection of permissionless blockchain. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the specific characteristics of permissionless blockchain, summarize the potential privacy threats, and investigate the unique privacy requirements of blockchain. Existing privacy preservation technologies are carefully surveyed and evaluated based on our proposed evaluation criteria. We finally figure out open research issues as well as future research directions from the perspective of privacy issues.","author":[{"family":"Peng","given":"Li"},{"family":"Feng","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Zheng"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yafeng"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Xiaokang"},{"family":"Shimizu","given":"Shohei"}],"citation-key":"pengPrivacyPreservationPermissionless2021","container-title":"DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKS","DOI":"10.1016/j.dcan.2020.05.008","ISSN":"2468-5925","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,8]]},"page":"295-307","title":"Privacy preservation in permissionless blockchain: A survey","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"pengReviewBlockchainSmart2023","abstract":"With the continuous development of the new crown epidemic and the outbreak of the Russian-Ukrainian war, the world is facing a serious food crisis, especially the agri-food (agricultural and food) crisis. The research of blockchain smart contracts in the agri-food industry has attracted great attention. To judge its trend, this research adopts the methods of bibliometric analysis and content analysis to conduct a comprehensive review and content analysis of the blockchain smart contract research in this industry. A general framework for blockchain smart contract research applied to the agri-food industry is proposed. Firstly, 78 relevant literatures were screened from 6 databases including the web of science and the Derwent Innovations Index for this review. Bibliometrics analyzes previous research from five dimensions, including publication year, document type and publication journal, country, author, and keywords. Secondly, the content analysis identified 4 issues, such as agri-food data storage, agri-food information management and control, agri-food data traceability, and agri-food data rights confirmation. Thirdly, the general framework provides a general research method for blockchain smart contracts. Finally, the advantages, challenges and development trends of blockchain smart contract research in the agrifood industry are discussed. This paper makes a qualitative and quantitative analysis of blockchain smart contracts in the agri-food industry, and clarifies the research status, challenges and development trends. We provide a common framework that contributes to the body of knowledge that will facilitate greater strategic adoption and use of blockchain smart contracts in the agri-food industry.","author":[{"family":"Peng","given":"Xiangzhen"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Zhiyao"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiaoyi"},{"family":"Li","given":"Haisheng"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Jiping"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xin"}],"citation-key":"pengReviewBlockchainSmart2023","container-title":"COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE","DOI":"10.1016/j.compag.2023.107776","ISSN":"0168-1699","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,5]]},"title":"A review on blockchain smart contracts in the agri-food industry: Current state, application challenges and future trends","type":"article-journal","volume":"208"},

  {"id":"pereraBlockchainTechnologyIt2020","abstract":"The dawn of the 21st century has seen the advent of many technologies targeting commercial and financial sectors. These include Big Data, Internet of Things and FinTechs such as blockchain. Blockchain is a type of a distributed database that is used to replicate, share, and synchronise data spread across different geographical locations such as multiple sites, countries, or organisations. The main property of blockchain is that there is no central administrator or centralised data storage mechanism. Consensus algorithms govern the peer-to-peer decentralised network. Numerous benefits and applications of blockchains have resulted in it becoming popular among a broad spectrum of businesses, but is it the case in the construction industry? Given, the backward nature of the construction industry in digitalisation and its reticence to change, it becomes important to analyse the potential impact of Blockchains as a potential disruptive technology. Although there exists a significant research gap and the potential possibility to test blockchain in the construction sector, the construction industry is historically reported as the second lowest sector to have adopted information technology. This leads to a conundrum whether blockchain is a pure technological hype or whether there is a real potential application in construction. The paper is aimed at critically analysing the application potential of blockchains in construction through a use case analysis and comprehensive literature review to resolve whether it is pure hype or real. The exploration revealed that due to the exponential uses of blockchain, investments involved, and a number of start-up businesses contributing to Industry 4.0, blockchain indeed has a credible potential in the construction industry.","author":[{"family":"Perera","given":"Srinath"},{"family":"Nanayakkara","given":"Samudaya"},{"family":"Rodrigo","given":"M.

The IoT global market is expected to grow from 170 billion USD in 2017 to 560 billion USD by 2022. Though many experts have pegged IoT as the next industrial revolution, two of the major challenging aspects of IoT since the early days are having a secure privacy-safe ecosystem encompassing all building blocks of IoT architecture and solve the scalability problem as the number of devices increases. In recent years, Distributed Ledgers have often been referred to as the solution for both privacy and security problems. One form of distributed ledger is the Blockchain system. The aim of this paper consists of reviewing the most recent Blockchain architectures, comparing the most interesting and popular consensus algorithms, and evaluating the convergence between Blockchain and IoT by illustrating some of the main interesting projects in this research field. Furthermore, the paper provides a vision of a disruptive research topic that the authors are investigating: the use of AI algorithms to be applied to IoT devices belonging to a Blockchain architecture. This obviously requires that the devices be provided with adequate computational capacity and that can efficiently optimize their energy consumption.","author":[{"family":"Pieroni","given":"Alessandra"},{"family":"Scarpato","given":"Noemi"},{"family":"Felli","given":"Lorenzo"}],"citation-key":"pieroniBlockchainIoTConvergenceA2020","container-title":"APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL","DOI":"10.3390/app10196749","issue":"19","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,10]]},"title":"Blockchain and IoT Convergence-A Systematic Survey on Technologies, Protocols and Security","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},

The explosive development of distributed ledger technology following the proposal of `Bitcoin' led to a sharp increase in research activity in this area. Specifically, public and permissionless networks require robust leader selection strategies resistant to Sybil attacks in which malicious attackers present bogus identities to induce byzantine faults. Our goal is to analyse the entire breadth of works in this area systematically, thereby uncovering trends and research directions regarding Sybil attack resistance in today's blockchain systems to benefit the designs of the future. Through a systematic literature review, we condense an immense set of research records (N = 21,799) to a relevant subset (N = 483). We categorise these mechanisms by their Sybil attack resistance characteristics, leader selection methodology, and incentive scheme. Mechanisms with strong Sybil attack resistance commonly adopt the principles underlying `Proof-of-Work' or `Proof-of-Stake' while mechanisms with limited resistance often use reputation systems or physical world linking. We find that only a few fundamental paradigms exist that can resist Sybil attacks in a permissionless setting but discover numerous innovative mechanisms that can deliver weaker protection in system scenarios with smaller attack surfaces.","author":[{"family":"Platt","given":"Moritz"},{"family":"McBurney","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"plattSybilHaystackComprehensive2023","container-title":"ALGORITHMS","DOI":"10.3390/a16010034","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,1]]},"title":"Sybil in the Haystack: A Comprehensive Review of Blockchain Consensus Mechanisms in Search of Strong Sybil Attack Resistance","type":"article-journal","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"pooyaMODELCHALLENGESSMART2020","abstract":"Many believe that smart contract can provide an innovative solution to some of the real-world problems. Thus, it is expected that blockchain-based smart contracts can dramatically increase economic efficiency and productivity in financial, banking and capital markets. In fact, smart contracts are a powerful novel tool for major changes in the financial, legal and contractual systems of the future, which will change the business model, create efficiency and added value, reduce legal disputes and increase the speed and transparency of financial transactions. Another innovative solution of smart contracts is their wide application in the internet of objects (IoT). For example, smart contract can be used to track goods in smart transport system, or it can be applied in future smart cars without a driver in order to pay for gasoline when fueling or pay for the insurance in the case of an accident automatically and immediately. Due to the widespread applications of smart contract in e-government, supply chain, intellectual property creation, patient electronic records, electronic voting, electronic insurance, smart transport and so on, its importance is clearly identified. Therefore, considering the emergence of smart contracts and given the scattered studies in this field, an attempt has been made to present a comprehensive and systematic model of the challenges of smart contract based on blockchain technology and the distributed ledger by the systematic review of previous studies (papers published in internationally accredited journals and theses reviewed between 2016 and 2019), using a meta-synthesis qualitative research method and Sandelowski and Barroso's (2006) seven-step model.","author":[{"family":"Pooya","given":"Amin"},{"family":"Chaghoushi","given":"Ahmad Jafarnejad"},{"family":"Shokohyar","given":"Sajad"},{"family":"Karimizand","given":"Mahdi"}],"citation-key":"pooyaMODELCHALLENGESSMART2020","container-title":"REVISTA GENERO & DIREITO","ISSN":"2177-0409","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"page":"821-844","title":"THE MODEL OF CHALLENGES OF SMART CONTRACT BASED ON BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY AND DISTRIBUTED LEDGER USING META-SYNTHESIS RESEARCH METHOD","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"prasadVMFCVDOptimizedFramework2022","abstract":"Despite significant development in distributed denial of service (DDoS) defense systems, the downtime caused by DDoS damages reputation, crushes end-user experience, and leads to considerable revenue loss. Volumetric DDoS attacks are the most common form of DDoS attack and are carried out by an army of infected IoT devices or by reflector servers, which increase attacks at massive scales. In this work, we propose a voting-based multimode framework to combat volumetric DDoS (VMFCVD) attacks. VMFCVD is based on a triad of fast detection mode (FDM), defensive fast detection mode (DFDM), and high accuracy mode (HAM) methods. FDM is designed to classify network traffic when the server is under attack. The highly dimensionally reduced dataset helps FDM accelerate detection speed. During our experiment, the dimension reduction for FDM was more than 97% while maintaining an accuracy of 99.9% in most cases. DFDM is an extended version of FDM that enhances malicious network traffic detection accuracy by tightening the detection technique. HAM focuses on detection accuracy, showing substantial improvement over FDM and DFDM. HAM activates when the server is stable. VMFCVD is extensively experimented on the latest benchmark DDoS and botnet datasets, namely the CICIDS2017 (BoT & DDoS), CSE-CIC-IDS2018 (BoT & DDoS), CICDDoS2019 (DNS, LDAP, SSDP & SYN), DoHBrw2020, NBaIoT2018 (Mirai), UNSW2018 BoTIoT, and UNSW NB15 datasets. The VMFCVD results show that it outperforms recent studies. VMFCVD performs exceptionally well when the server is under DDoS attack.","author":[{"family":"Prasad","given":"Arvind"},{"family":"Chandra","given":"Shalini"}],"citation-key":"prasadVMFCVDOptimizedFramework2022","container-title":"ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING","DOI":"10.1007/s13369-021-06484-9","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,8]]},"page":"9965-9983","title":"VMFCVD: An Optimized Framework to Combat Volumetric DDoS Attacks using Machine Learning","type":"article-journal","volume":"47"},

Among the existing technologies, fifth generation (5G) schemes are expected to be the motivating force for the realisation of IoT concept. This research paper reviews existing state-of-art on the secure communication for 5G and IoT networks. We have created a taxonomy and categorised the research works based on the protocols such as light weight authentication protocol, trust-aware routing protocol, service-oriented authentication protocol, and application-oriented protocol. The research gaps and the challenges faced for secure communication in 5G and IoT networks are listed for further enhancement in the security protocols. We further analysed the research work based on the classification methods, performance metrics, and the year of publication. Our analysis reveals that the most commonly used classification technique is trust-aware routing protocols, and the most frequently used performance metrics is execution time, the execution time of most of the research work lies between 10 ms to 300 ms, and the communication overhead ranges from 1 x 10(5) bits to 5 x 10(5) bits.","author":[{"family":"Premalatha","given":"J."},{"family":"Swamidason","given":"Iwin Thanakumar Joseph"},{"family":"Harshavardhanan","given":"Pon"},{"family":"Anandaraj","given":"S.

  {"id":"premkumarPelicanOptimizationAlgorithm2023","abstract":"Rapid advancements in innovation, the Internet of Things (IoT), and edge computing have provided room for companies, government agencies, well-being administrations, and organizations to offer their kind of assistance through the cloud. Operating these cloud administrations requires monetary and computational assets to acquire and protect information from vindictive elements and to handle the multitude of information these administrations generate through nervous and IoT gadgets. Scalability, system availability, network transmission, and load relocation are some of the issues with the parallel file system. In the literature, few works are reviewed for obtaining load balancing but it does not consider the secure authentication phase in fog computing. Secure authentication and load balancing are critical challenges in a fog computing environment. In this paper, we develop Adaptive Load Balancing and Secure Authentication (ALBSA) for managing load balancing schemes and secure authentication schemes in fog computing. Normally, the Edge Data Centres (EDC) are utilized to set up as a distributed system and it is located among the data source and cloud datacentre. So, the proposed ALBSA is utilized to enable efficient authentication and workload management (load balancing). The proposed method is a combination of Blockchain technology and the Pelican Optimization Algorithm (POA). Based on resource utilization and response time, efficient load balancing is achieved. Additionally, this paper develops a blockchain-based authentication system that utilizes the characteristics and advantages of blockchain and smart contracts to authenticate users securely. The implemented system uses the email address, username, Ethereum address, password, and data from a biometric reader to register and authenticate users. The proposed methodology is implemented and evaluated based on performance metrics. To justify the efficiency of the proposed technique, it is contrasted with the traditional techniques. The proposed method is achieved, Encryption time is 4.2ms, the waiting time is 0.28ms and the decryption time is 10.21ms.","author":[{"family":"Premkumar","given":"N."},{"family":"Santhosh","given":"R."}],"citation-key":"premkumarPelicanOptimizationAlgorithm2023","container-title":"MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS","DOI":"10.1007/s11042-023-17632-8","ISSN":"1380-7501","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,18]]},"title":"Pelican optimization algorithm with blockchain for secure load balancing in fog computing","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"qiuApplicationsAuctionMechanism2022","abstract":"Edge computing as a promising technology provides lower latency, more efficient transmission, and faster speed of data processing since the edge servers are closer to the user devices. Each edge server with limited resources can offload latency-sensitive and computation-intensive tasks from nearby user devices. However, edge computing faces challenges such as resource allocation, energy consumption, security and privacy issues, etc. Auction mechanisms can well characterize bidirectional interactions between edge servers and user devices under the above constraints in edge computing. As demonstrated by the existing works, auction and mechanism design approaches are outstanding on achieving optimal allocation strategy while guaranteeing mutual satisfaction among edge servers and user devices, especially for scenarios with scarce resources. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive survey of recent researches that apply auction approaches in edge computing. Firstly, a brief overview of edge computing including three common edge computing paradigms, i.e., cloudlet, fog computing and mobile edge computing, is presented. Then, we introduce fundamentals and backgrounds of auction schemes commonly used in edge computing systems. After then, a comprehensive survey of applications of auction-based approaches applied for edge computing is provided, which is categorized by different auction approaches. Finally, several open challenges and promising research directions are discussed.","author":[{"family":"Qiu","given":"Houming"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Kun"},{"family":"Luong","given":"Nguyen Cong"},{"family":"Yi","given":"Changyan"},{"family":"Niyato","given":"Dusit"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Dong In"}],"citation-key":"qiuApplicationsAuctionMechanism2022","container-title":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COGNITIVE COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING","DOI":"10.1109/TCCN.2022.3147196","ISSN":"2332-7731","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,6]]},"page":"1034-1058","title":"Applications of Auction and Mechanism Design in Edge Computing: A Survey","type":"article-journal","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"qiuSurveyAccessControl2020","abstract":"With the development of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology, various types of information, such as social resources and physical resources, are deeply integrated for different comprehensive applications. Social networking, car networking, medical services, video surveillance, and other forms of the IoT information service model gradually change people's daily lives. Facing the vast amounts of IoT information data, the IoT search technology is used to quickly find accurate information to meet the real-time search needs of users. However, IoT search requires using a large amount of user private information, such as personal health information, location information, and social relations information, to provide personalized services. Employing private information from users will encounter security problems if an effective access control mechanism is missing during the IoT search process. An access control mechanism can effectively monitor the access activities of resources and ensure that authorized users access information resources under legitimate conditions. This survey examines the growing literature on access control for an IoT search. Problems and challenges of access control mechanisms are analyzed to facilitate the adoption of access control solutions in real-life settings.

  {"id":"radanlievReviewComparisonUS2023","abstract":"The first cryptocurrency was invented in 2008/09, but the Blockchain-Web3 concept is still in its infancy, and the cyber risk is constantly changing. Cybersecurity should also be adapting to these changes to ensure security of personal data and continuation of operations. This article starts with a comparison of existing cybersecurity standards and regulations from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO)-ISO27001, followed by a discussion on more specific and recent standards and regulations, such as the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (CPMI-IOSCO), and more general cryptography (and post-quantum cryptography), in the context of cybersecurity. These topics are followed up by a review of recent technical reports on cyber risk/security and a discussion on cloud security questions. Comparison of Blockchain cyber risk is also performed on the recent EU standards on cyber security, including European Cybersecurity Certification Scheme (EUCS)-cloud, and US standards-The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The study includes a review of Blockchain endpoint security, and new technologies e.g., IoT. The research methodology applied is a review and case study analysing secondary data on cybersecurity. The research significance is the integration of knowledge from the United States (US), the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom (UK), and international standards and frameworks on cybersecurity that can be alighted to new Blockchain projects. The results show that cybersecurity standards are not designed in close cooperation between the two major western blocks: US and EU. In addition, while the US is still leading in this area, the security standards for cryptocurrencies, internet-of-things, and blockchain technologies have not evolved as fast as the technologies have. The key finding from this study is that although the crypto-market has grown into a multi-trillion industry, the crypto-market has also lost over 70% since its peak, causing significant financial loss for individuals and cooperation's. Despite this significant impact to individuals and society, cybersecurity standards and financial governance regulations are still in their infancy, specifically in the UK.","author":[{"family":"Radanliev","given":"Petar"}],"citation-key":"radanlievReviewComparisonUS2023","container-title":"REVIEW OF SOCIONETWORK STRATEGIES","DOI":"10.1007/s12626-023-00139-x","ISSN":"2523-3173","issue":"2, SI","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,10]]},"page":"105-129","title":"Review and Comparison of US, EU, and UK Regulations on Cyber Risk/Security of the Current Blockchain Technologies: Viewpoint from 2023","type":"article-journal","volume":"17"},
  {"id":"raduDisruptiveTechnologiesSmart2020","abstract":"This paper aims to explore the most important disruptive technologies in the development of the smart city. Every smart city is a dynamic and complex system that attracts an increasing number of people in search of the benefits of urbanisation. According to the United Nations, 68% of the world population will be living in cities by 2050. This creates challenges related to limited resources and infrastructure (energy, water, transportation system, etc.). To solve these problems, new and emerging technologies are created. Internet of Things, big data, blockchain, artificial intelligence, data analytics, and machine and cognitive learning are just a few examples. They generate changes in key sectors such as health, energy, transportation, education, public safety, etc. Based on a comprehensive literature review, we identified the main disruptive technologies in smart cities. Applications that integrate these technologies help cities to be smarter and offer better living conditions and easier access to products and services for residents. Disruptive technologies are generally considered key drivers in smart city progress. This paper presents these disruptive technologies, their applications in smart cities, the most important challenges and critics.","author":[{"family":"Radu","given":"Laura-Diana"}],"citation-key":"raduDisruptiveTechnologiesSmart2020","container-title":"SMART CITIES","DOI":"10.3390/smartcities3030051","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,9]]},"page":"1022-1038","title":"Disruptive Technologies in Smart Cities: A Survey on Current Trends and Challenges","type":"article-journal","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"ragothamanAccessControlIoT2023","abstract":"Internet of Things (IoT) provides a wide range of services in domestic and industrial environments. Access control plays a crucial role in granting access rights to users and devices when an IoT device is connected to a network. However, many challenges exist in designing and implementing an ideal access control solution for the IoT due to the characteristics of the IoT including but not limited to the variety of the IoT devices, the resource constraints on the IoT devices, and the heterogeneous nature of the IoT. This paper conducts a comprehensive survey on access control in the IoT, including access control requirements, authorization architecture, access control models, access control policies, access control research challenges, and future directions. It identifies and summarizes key access control requirements in the IoT. The paper further evaluates the existing access control models to fulfill the access control requirements. Access control decisions are governed by access control policies. The existing approaches on dynamic policies' specification are reviewed. The challenges faced by the existing solutions for policies' specification are highlighted. Finally, the paper presents the research challenges and future directions of access control in the IoT. Due to the variety of IoT applications, there is no one-size-fits-all solution for access control in the IoT. Despite the challenges encountered in designing and implementing the access control in the IoT, it is desired to have an access control solution to meet all the identified requirements to secure the IoT.","author":[{"family":"Ragothaman","given":"Kaushik"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yong"},{"family":"Rimal","given":"Bhaskar"},{"family":"Lawrence","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"ragothamanAccessControlIoT2023","container-title":"SENSORS","DOI":"10.3390/s23041805","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,2]]},"title":"Access Control for IoT: A Survey of Existing Research, Dynamic Policies and Future Directions","type":"article-journal","volume":"23"},

There is a significant growth in the amount and complexity of Internet of Things devices that are deployed in a wider range of environments. These devices mostly communicate through Wi-Fi networks and particularly in smart environments. Besides the benefits, these devices also introduce security challenges. In this paper, we investigate and leverage effective feature selection techniques to improve intrusion detection using machine learning methods. The proposed approach is based on a centralised intrusion detection system, which uses the deep feature abstraction, feature selection and classification to train the model for detecting the malicious and anomalous actions in the traffic. The deep feature abstraction uses deep learning techniques of artificial neural network in the form of unsupervised autoencoder to construct more features for the traffic. Based on the availability of cumulative features, the system then employs a variety of wrapper-based feature selection techniques ranging from SVM and decision tree to Naive Bayes for selecting high-ranked features, which are then combined and fed into an artificial neural network classifier for distinguishing attack and normal behaviors. The experimental results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed method on Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion Dataset, which achieves high detection accuracy of up to 99.95%, relatively competitive to the existing machine learning works for the same dataset.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Rahman","given":"Md Arafatur"},{"family":"Asyhari","given":"A.

  {"id":"rahmanICNIoTFederatedLearning2023","abstract":"The individual and integration use of the Internet of Things (IoT), Information-Centric Networking (ICN), and Federated Learning (FL) have recently been used in several network-related scenarios and have consequently experienced a growing interest in the research community. Federated learning addresses the privacy and security issues of the IoT data in a decentralized manner. Also, it can be capable of training the multiple learning algorithms through local content except for exchanging data through intelligent Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based algorithms. Moreover, in ICN, the content is retrieved and stored based on the content name rather than the content location address. On the other hand, it is challenging to support the massive IoT devices by the fifth generation (5G) mobile-cellular networks. Therefore, the cellular 6G networks are expected to increase the connection capabilities by 10-100 times over 5G, which necessitates a convergence of Communication, Computing, and Caching (3C). At the same time, the in-network caching capabilities of ICN can be attractive features for IoT networks. IoT aspires to link anybody and/or everything at any time and location. However, integrating IoT with different areas is a new academic topic and is still in its infancy. As a result, this research highlights the potential of ICN for IoTs by conducting an exhaustive literature review. This work provides a comprehensive survey regarding these three recent research trends (i.e., FL, IoT, and ICN) and reviews the related state-of-the-art literature. We first describe the main features of each technology and discuss their most common and used variants. Furthermore, we envision the integration of such technologies to take advantage efficiently. Indeed, we consider their group-wise (FL-ICN-IoT) utilization based on the need for more robust security and privacy. Additionally, we cover the application fields of these technologies both individually and combinedly.

  {"id":"raniFederatedLearningSecure2023","abstract":"Recent developments in the Internet of Things (IoT) and various communication technologies have reshaped numerous application areas. Nowadays, IoT is assimilated into various medical devices and equipment, leading to the progression of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Therefore, various IoMT-based healthcare applications are deployed and used in the day-to-day scenario. Traditionally, machine learning (ML) models use centralized data compilation and learning that is impractical in pragmatic healthcare frameworks due to rising privacy and data security issues. Federated Learning (FL) has been observed as a developing distributed collective paradigm, the most appropriate for modern healthcare framework, that manages various stakeholders (e.g., patients, hospitals, laboratories, etc.) to carry out training of the models without the actual exchange of sensitive medical data. Consequently, in this work, the authors present an exhaustive survey on the security of FL-based IoMT applications in smart healthcare frameworks. First, the authors introduced IoMT devices, their types, applications, datasets, and the IoMT security framework in detail. Subsequently, the concept of FL, its application domains, and various tools used to develop FL applications are discussed. The significant contribution of FL in deploying secure IoMT systems is presented by focusing on FL-based IoMT applications, patents, real-world FL-based healthcare projects, and datasets. A comparison of FL-based security techniques with other schemes in the smart healthcare ecosystem is also presented. Finally, the authors discussed the challenges faced and potential future research recommendations to deploy secure FL-based IoMT applications in smart healthcare frameworks.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

  {"id":"rattaApplicationBlockchainInternet2021","abstract":"Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the recent innovations in Information Technology, which intends to interconnect the physical and digital worlds. It introduces a vision of smartness by enabling communication between objects and humans through the Internet. IoT has diverse applications in almost all sectors like Smart Health, Smart Transportation, and Smart Cities, etc. In healthcare applications, IoT eases communication between doctors and patients as the latter can be diagnosed remotely in emergency scenarios through body sensor networks and wearable sensors. However, using IoT in healthcare systems can lead to violation of the privacy of patients. Thus, security should be taken into consideration. Blockchain is one of the trending research topics nowadays and can be applied to the majority of IoT scenarios. Few major reasons for using the Blockchain in healthcare systems are its prominent features, i.e., Decentralization, Immutability, Security and Privacy, and Transparency. This paper's main objective was to enhance the functionality of healthcare systems using emerging and innovative computer technologies like IoT and Blockchain. So, initially, a brief introduction to the basic concepts of IoT and Blockchain is provided. After this, the applicability of IoT and Blockchain in the medical sector is explored in three major areas-drug traceability, remote patient-monitoring, and medical record management. At last, the challenges of deploying IoT and Blockchain in healthcare systems are discussed.","author":[{"family":"Ratta","given":"Pranav"},{"family":"Kaur","given":"Amanpreet"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Sparsh"},{"family":"Shabaz","given":"Mohammad"},{"family":"Dhiman","given":"Gaurav"}],"citation-key":"rattaApplicationBlockchainInternet2021","container-title":"JOURNAL OF FOOD QUALITY","DOI":"10.1155/2021/7608296","ISSN":"0146-9428","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,25]]},"title":"Application of Blockchain and Internet of Things in Healthcare and Medical Sector: Applications, Challenges, and Future Perspectives","type":"article-journal","volume":"2021"},

The proposed model extracts the features of hidden layers of recurrent models and further employs a kernel-based principal component analysis (KPCA) feature selection approach to identify optimal features. Finally, the optimal features of recurrent models are fused together and classification is done using an ensemble meta-classifier. Experimental analysis and results of the proposed method on more than one benchmark network intrusion dataset show that the proposed method performed better than the existing methods and other most commonly used machine learning and deep learning models.

  {"id":"rayBlockchainIoTBasedHealthcare2021","abstract":"Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technologies are being heavily exploited and used in may domains, especially for e-healthcare. In healthcare, IoT devices have the ability to provide real-time sensory data from patients to be processed and analyzed. Collected IoT data are subjected to centralized computation, processing, and storage. Such centralization can be problematic, as it can be a single point of failure, mistrust, data manipulation and tampering, and privacy evasion. Blockchain can solve such serious problems by providing decentralized computation and storage for IoT data. Therefore, the integration IoT and blockchain technologies can become a reasonable choice for the design of a decentralized IoT-based e-healthcare systems. In this article, first, we give a brief background on blockchain. Second, popular consensus algorithms used in blockchain are discussed in the context of e-health. Third, blockchain platforms are reviewed for their appropriateness in IoT-based e-healthcare. Finally, few use cases are methodologically given to show how key features of the IoT and blockchain can be leveraged to support healthcare services and ecosystems. We also propose a data-flow architecture that combines the IoT with blockchain, called IoBHealth, that can be used for storing, accessing, and managing of e-healthcare data.","author":[{"family":"Ray","given":"Partha Pratim"},{"family":"Dash","given":"Dinesh"},{"family":"Salah","given":"Khaled"},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Neeraj"}],"citation-key":"rayBlockchainIoTBasedHealthcare2021","container-title":"IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL","DOI":"10.1109/JSYST.2020.2963840","ISSN":"1932-8184","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3]]},"page":"85-94","title":"Blockchain for IoT-Based Healthcare: Background, Consensus, Platforms, and Use Cases","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},

Thus, a stringent or directed pathway is either not known or not paved till date. Blockchain is a recent technology that can provide trustless facility to the connected nodes acting as cancer research centers around the world to pave a directed way of consensus-centric research validation. Thus, in this chapter we first present the usefulness of blockchain for cancer care and research. Second, we provide current trends in blockchain-based cancer care. Third, we present a novel blockchain system model, i.e., BCCANA for cancer diagnosis, treatment, cure, and management. We further discuss cryptocurrencies for cancer care. Lastly, key open challenges are identified and future road map is discussed.

Later, it provides the current operations of the healthcare system and discusses the mapping of these operations into the architectural diagram. Further, several emerging technologies such as Physically Unclonable Functions (PUF), Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) are envisioned as important technologies to overcome several challenges in e-healthcare such as security, privacy, accuracy, and performance. Finally, we provide three case studies for IoMT based on - (1) PUF-based Authentication, (2) AI-enabled SDN Assisted e-healthcare, and (3) Blockchain Assisted Patient Centric System.

As the IoT will soon pervade every aspect of our lives and will be accessible from anywhere, addressing critical IoT security threats is now more important than ever. Traditional approaches where security is applied as an afterthought and as a “patch” against known attacks are insufficient. Indeed, next-generation IoT challenges will require a new secure-by-design vision, where threats are addressed proactively and IoT devices learn to dynamically adapt to different threats. To this end, machine learning (ML) and software-defined networking (SDN) will be key to provide both reconfigurability and intelligence to the IoT devices.

  {"id":"riahiRLBasedFederatedLearning2023","abstract":"Federated learning (FL) paradigms aim to amalgamate diverse data properties stored locally at each user, while preserving data privacy through sharing users' learning experiences and iteratively aggregating their local learning models into a global one. However, the majority of FL architectures with centralized cloud do not guarantee the trust in sharing users' models, and hence, open the door for slowing and/or contaminating the global learning experience. In this paper, we propose a decentralized Blockchain (BC)-based framework and define a comprehensive protocol for exchanging local models, in order to guarantee users' mutual trust while sharing their local learning experiences. We then propose a technique to optimize the global learning experience using Reinforcement Learning (RL), namely RL-FL-BC, to tackle the trade-off between information age of the learning parameters, data skewness (i.e., non-iid), and BC transaction cost (i.e., Ether price). We implement the proposed framework in a realistic containerized environment to facilitate the comparative study of the RL-FL-BC technique with baselines techniques. Our results show the efficacy of the BC-based protocol to facilitate the exchange of both the models' and the optimization parameters to guarantee users' mutual trust, while improving global learning performance compared to baselines techniques.","author":[{"family":"Riahi","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Mohamed","given":"Amr"},{"family":"Erbad","given":"Aiman"}],"citation-key":"riahiRLBasedFederatedLearning2023","container-title":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORK AND SERVICE MANAGEMENT","DOI":"10.1109/TNSM.2023.3241437","ISSN":"1932-4537","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,6]]},"page":"1587-1599","title":"RL-Based Federated Learning Framework Over Blockchain (RL-FL-BC)","type":"article-journal","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"royDevicespecificSecurityChallenges2023","abstract":"Rapid growth in IoT technology demands the need for the emergence of new IoT devices. IoT devices vary in terms of shape, size, storage, battery life, and computational power according to the specific purposes for which they are utilized. Also, since IoT devices are geographically dispersed, they are vulnerable to remote/physical attacks. Numerous research works are done to mitigate the challenges using software methods. However, in the last few decades, it is evident that software methods fail to protect IoT devices against hardware threats. The need for preventing hardware attacks drives the researchers to find a solution from a hardware perspective. This paper investigates and examines the security challenges faced by IoT devices by focusing on their hardware aspects. The outcome of the study is presented as a survey, signifying the existing solutions for different challenges. The survey primarily focuses on three major challenges: device authentication, IP protection, and hardware Trojan. Out of the analysis of 111 related schemes, it is clear that 30.6% are PUF-based schemes. A comparative study on the hardware parameter analysis of existing solutions has been performed. From this analysis, a few unresolved issues and directions for future research are identified. We expect this survey to be helpful for the research community working on hardware security challenges faced by IoT devices.","author":[{"family":"Roy","given":"Aditi"},{"family":"Kokila","given":"J."},{"family":"Ramasubramanian","given":"N."},{"family":"Begum","given":"B.

  {"id":"rulloRedundancyMeasureFaultTolerance2019","abstract":"In this paper we review and analyze redundancy-based fault-tolerant techniques for the IoT as a paradigm to support two of the main goals of computer security: availability and integrity. We organized the presentation in terms of the three main tasks performed by the nodes of an IoT network: sensing, routing, and control. We first discuss how the implementation of fault-tolerance in the three areas is primary for the correct operation of an entire system. We provide an overview of the different approaches that have been used to address failures in sensing and routing. Control devices typically implement state machines that take decisions based on the measurement of sensors and may also ask actuators to execute actions. Traditionally state-machine replication for fault-tolerance is realized through consensus protocols. Most protocols were developed in the 80's and 90's. We will review the properties of such protocols in detail and discuss their limitations for the IoT. Since 2008, consensus algorithms took a new direction with the introduction of the concept of blockchain. Standard blockchain based protocols cannot be applied without modifications to support fault-tolerance in the IoT. We will review some recent results in this new class of algorithms, and show how they can provide the flexibility required to support fault-tolerance in control devices, and thus overcome some of the limitations of the traditional consensus protocols.","author":[{"family":"Rullo","given":"Antonino"},{"family":"Serra","given":"Edoardo"},{"family":"Lobo","given":"Jorge"}],"citation-key":"rulloRedundancyMeasureFaultTolerance2019","collection-title":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science","container-title":"POLICY-BASED AUTONOMIC DATA GOVERNANCE (PADG 2018)","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-17277-0_11","editor":[{"family":"Calo","given":"S"},{"family":"Bertino","given":"E"},{"family":"Verma","given":"D"}],"ISBN":"978-3-030-17277-0 978-3-030-17276-3","ISSN":"0302-9743","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"page":"202-226","publisher":"Univ Politecnica Catalunya BarcelonaTech; UK US Distributed Analyt & Informat Sci Int Technol Alliance","title":"Redundancy as a Measure of Fault-Tolerance for the Internet of Things: A Review","type":"paper-conference","volume":"11550"},

The aim of this paper is to provide a more comprehensive overview of current and potential examples of DT applications in SPM (e.g., product design/assessment, supply chain management, and business models). The collected examples (n = 146) were analyzed based on a systematic literature review, using quantitative and qualitative content analysis. Deductive and inductive analyses of the examples revealed the potential of DTs in terms of their usability along the product life cycle, their role as enablers for circular economy strategies and in specific SPM activities. DT application often entails only incremental improvements, for example, increased efficiency of existing processes, with more radical forms of improvement remaining relatively scarce. There is clear room for greater adoption and optimization of DTs, in various areas of SPM, so as to accelerate the transition towards a more sustainable and circular economy.","author":[{"family":"Rusch","given":"Magdalena"},{"family":"Schoeggl","given":"Josef-Peter"},{"family":"Baumgartner","given":"Rupert J."}],"citation-key":"ruschApplicationDigitalTechnologies2023","container-title":"BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT","DOI":"10.1002/bse.3099","ISSN":"0964-4733","issue":"3, SI","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,3]]},"page":"1159-1174","title":"Application of digital technologies for sustainable product management in a circular economy: A review","type":"article-journal","volume":"32"},

  {"id":"sadeghi-niarakiInternetThingIoT2023","abstract":"The Internet of Things (IoT) uses embedded sensors and networks to intelligently connect our surrounded objects and improve quality of life. A huge number of review research studies have been published that review previous IoT related research and more recent advances in a wide number of different IoT technologies and applications. However, as yet, there has not been any meta-review conducted to comprehensively analyze all current IoT review publications. The main objective of this survey is to present the research community with an overview and analysis of IoT review studies that have been published so far, and what challenges still remain that need to be addressed in this field. This paper also attempts to report the enabling factors that were identified, as well as the weaknesses and the risk factors in the current published survey papers. First, IoT review publications were classified into eight categories: IoT applications, types, security, data, communication networks, development, protocol standards, and technologies. Second, the bibliometric indicators were used to identify the leading trends in the IoT field. Third, a graphical/spatial mapping of the bibliographic material, journals and author co-citation networks, the bibliometric coupling of countries, and the co-occurrence of keyword network maps were developed from the IoT reviews. The results indicate that IoT applications, technologies, and security categories had the highest number of publications, whereas the IoT data and network categories had the lowest amount of publications, each of them had less than 5.5% of the total.

  {"id":"sadhuInternetThingsSecurity2022","abstract":"The overwhelming acceptance and growing need for Internet of Things (IoT) products in each aspect of everyday living is creating a promising prospect for the involvement of humans, data, and procedures. The vast areas create opportunities from home to industry to make an automated lifecycle. Human life is involved in enormous applications such as intelligent transportation, intelligent healthcare, smart grid, smart city, etc. A thriving surface is created that can affect society, the economy, the environment, politics, and health through diverse security threats. Generally, IoT devices are susceptible to security breaches, and the development of industrial systems could pose devastating security vulnerabilities. To build a reliable security shield, the challenges encountered must be embraced. Therefore, this survey paper is primarily aimed to assist researchers by classifying attacks/vulnerabilities based on objects. The method of attacks and relevant countermeasures are provided for each kind of attack in this work. Case studies of the most important applications of the IoT are highlighted concerning security solutions. The survey of security solutions is not limited to traditional secret key-based cryptographic solutions, moreover physical unclonable functions (PUF)-based solutions and blockchain are illustrated. The pros and cons of each security solution are also discussed here. Furthermore, challenges and recommendations are presented in this work.","author":[{"family":"Sadhu","given":"Pintu Kumar"},{"family":"Yanambaka","given":"Venkata P."},{"family":"Abdelgawad","given":"Ahmed"}],"citation-key":"sadhuInternetThingsSecurity2022","container-title":"SENSORS","DOI":"10.3390/s22197433","issue":"19","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,10]]},"title":"Internet of Things: Security and Solutions Survey","type":"article-journal","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"sadiqueDIdMEIoTDDistributedIdentity2023","abstract":"The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm aims to enhance human society and living standards with the vast deployment of smart and autonomous devices, which requires seamless collaboration. The number of connected devices increases daily, introducing identity management requirements for edge IoT devices. Due to IoT devices' heterogeneity and resource-constrained configuration, traditional identity management systems are not feasible. As a result, identity management for IoT devices is still an open issue. Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and blockchain-based security solutions are becoming popular in different application domains. This paper presents a novel DLT-based distributed identity management architecture for edge IoT devices. The model can be adapted with any IoT solution for secure and trustworthy communication between devices. We have comprehensively reviewed popular consensus mechanisms used in DLT implementations and their connection to IoT research, specifically identity management for Edge IoT devices. Our proposed location-based identity management model is generic, distributed, and decentralized. The proposed model is verified using the Scyther formal verification tool for security performance measurement. SPIN model checker is employed for different state verification of our proposed model. The open-source simulation tool FobSim is used for fog and edge/user layer DTL deployment performance analysis. The results and discussion section represents how our proposed decentralized identity management solution should enhance user data privacy and secure and trustworthy communication in IoT.","author":[{"family":"Sadique","given":"Kazi Masum"},{"family":"Rahmani","given":"Rahim"},{"family":"Johannesson","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"sadiqueDIdMEIoTDDistributedIdentity2023","container-title":"SENSORS","DOI":"10.3390/s23084046","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,4]]},"title":"DIdM-EIoTD: Distributed Identity Management for Edge Internet of Things (IoT) Devices","type":"article-journal","volume":"23"},

Although Internet access management techniques exist, they are using 3rd party or centralized techniques to offer a set of technical constraints to manage them globally. The Block-Chain (BC), a notebook technology, offers a solution to secure trust in decentralized systems, and combines the trust, consistency and use of the shared Ledger in a public network that could be useful for building confidence in Internet objects. However, the use of BC with Internet things by itself involves a lot of challenges and has become a hot topic. Therefore, a methodical review of literature is necessary to know what is the proposed on this subject. This paper discusses a survey of key issues and design factors in IoT security that need to be considered for Access Control (AC) model designers as the IoT security requirements. In addition, we offer a broad survey of modern AC frameworks in IoT object research. We classify the proposed mechanisms into two categories: traditional and decentralized.

  {"id":"sahaBlockchainSolutionSecurity2021","abstract":"In this paper, an Internet of Energy (IoE) solution for providing optimal charging and control of resources in the era of electric vehicles (EVs) with energy trading and security is considered. A blockchain based security solution is presented by considering the IoE as a distributed energy system with internet of things (IoT). However, by inheriting the security concerns of IoTs, IoE also faces the security challenges and is considered here. Hierarchical key generation is used for cryptographic keys, based on lattice constructions. Along with a consensus tailored with Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), an additional smart contract is also applied for utilization of energy transfer. The presented solution provides transparency, reliability, availability and failure recovery inheriting from the blockchain aspects. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first attempt in this direction of IoE-EV interface solutions. The experimental results, comparative analysis and security validation affirm the superiority of the proposed solution over the existing approaches.","author":[{"family":"Saha","given":"Rahul"},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Gulshan"},{"family":"Geetha","given":"G."},{"literal":"Tai-Hoon-Kim"},{"family":"Alazab","given":"Mamoun"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Reji"},{"family":"Rai","given":"Mritunjay Kumar"},{"family":"Rodrigues","given":"Joel J.

As developing countries around the globe are facing challenges to adopt and implement blockchain, this evidence-based systematic review aims to identify the implementation challenges of blockchain technology for developing countries. A total of 1,298 published documents during the period 2016-2021 from the Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and ScienceDirect databases were explored to recognize 19 appropriate publications for research analysis using a PRISMA flow diagram. Based on the identified challenges from the thorough reviews of these 19 publications, using the association technique, the authors developed four comprehensive themes as broad challenges: technological, governance, organizational and environmental, and knowledge. Later, they performed bibliometric analyses using VOSviewer 1.6.17, and based on the bibliometric evidence constructed term co-occurrence network plots. The results show that developing countries face challenges vis-a-vis technological, governance, organizational and environmental, and knowledge issues when implementing blockchain technology. Hence, to make blockchain adoption and implementation processes successful in developing countries, these broad categories of challenges must be properly addressed. In addition, practitioners of disruptive technology, policymakers, consultants, IT experts, business people, top company managers, and above all, respective governments need to pay attention to these challenges for accelerating the blockchain adoption and implementation process in developing countries.","author":[{"family":"Saif","given":"Abu Naser Mohammad"},{"family":"Islam","given":"K.

  {"id":"samanthSecurityInternetDrones2022","abstract":"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also called drones, are used for various applications with two basic classifications: civilian and military drones. Civilian drones are used for various applications like construction site monitoring, natural disaster area monitoring, agriculture, etc. Military drones are used for applications like monitoring a country's border, the transmission of information about the intruders to Ground Control Station (GCS), or to any other server which has been designed for the purpose. Before the real-time deployment of the Internet of Drones (IoD), the feasibility and efficiency of a proposed UAV framework should be tested in an open-source UAV simulator or any network simulator. AirSim simulator is an open-source UAV simulator that has different features like ease of development, efficient motion capture, efficient obstacle detections and collision detections, use of different sensor models, and physics models. Hence, a review has been done on recent UAV frameworks which have been designed and tested using the AirSim simulator. Since a vast amount of data is being transmitted between IoD devices in this era, there is a need for designing secure IoD communication frameworks, with the least compromise in the performance of the designed frameworks. Hence, an extensive review has been done on different secure IoD communication frameworks which have used different cryptography concepts like key agreement, authentication, encryption and decryption, integrity, blockchain, digital signatures, and have implemented their proposed frameworks in real-time, or by using network simulators. The common network simulators that have been used for simulating secure IoD frameworks/mechanisms are NS3 and OMNeT++.","author":[{"family":"Samanth","given":"Snehal"},{"family":"Prema","given":"K.","suffix":"V"},{"family":"Balachandra","given":"Mamatha"}],"citation-key":"samanthSecurityInternetDrones2022","container-title":"COGENT ENGINEERING","DOI":"10.1080/23311916.2022.2029080","ISSN":"2331-1916","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,31]]},"title":"Security in Internet of Drones: A Comprehensive Review","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},

In IoT environments, networking devices are typically resourceconstrained, which enable them, draw cyber threats targets. In this context, comprehensive efforts have been made, mainly through conventional cryptographic methods, to resolve privacy and security issues in IoT environments. The specific features of IoT devices, however, make current techniques inadequate to protect the IoT networks' extensive privacy spectrum. This is, at only in part, due to resource constraints, heterogeneity, vast IoT device-generated real-time data, and that networks extremely complex conduct. The present study aims to identify network behavior and detect anomalies on the IoT network. The proposed experimental setup improves the performance of IoT based Intrusion Detection S ystem for feature selection and dimensionality reduction. For feature selection, Chi-S quare and ExtraTree classifier with S VM and dimensionality reduction methods Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Firefly Algorithm (FA) used.

  {"id":"samiullahGroupKeyManagement2023","abstract":"IoT networks are gaining popularity in terms of group networks built by sensor nodes and other IoT-related devices. The significance of cryptography protocols for secure communication among nodes in such networks cannot be overstated. Effective point-to-point and multicast communication among groups of nodes is of paramount importance. The security of IoT necessitates the concealment of security protocols and keys that are transmitted between nodes. The management of group keys, commonly referred to as Group Key Management (GKM), is an essential component of secure group communication protocols. It is imperative to develop a Secure Group Communication (SCG) scheme that is designed for practical scenarios, taking into consideration the demands and constraints of real-life implementations. In addition, most of the existing GKM schemes are dependent on public-key cryptography which are vulnerable to quantum computers. This SLR evaluates 48 proposals identified in IEEE Xplore, Springer Link, MDPI, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Hindawi databases between 2013 and 2023. Moreover, we provide a classification of secure group communication schemes. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive performance and security evaluation of the SGC schemes. In addition to other security features, we consider quantum resistance to be one of the security features, and we describe the application and usage area considering a resource-constrained real-world scenario where GKM is the most important issue.","author":[{"family":"Samiullah","given":"Fouzia"},{"family":"Gan","given":"Ming-Lee"},{"family":"Akleylek","given":"Sedat"},{"family":"Aun","given":"Y."}],"citation-key":"samiullahGroupKeyManagement2023","container-title":"IEEE ACCESS","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3298024","ISSN":"2169-3536","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023]]},"page":"77464-77491","title":"Group Key Management in Internet of Things: A Systematic Literature Review","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"samySecureTaskOffloading2022","abstract":"Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a promising and fast-developing paradigm that provides cloud services at the edge of the network. MEC enables IoT devices to offload and execute their real-time applications at the proximity of these devices with low latency. Such applications include efficient manufacture inspection, virtual/augmented reality, image recognition, Internet of Vehicles (IoV), and e-Health. However, task offloading experiences security and privacy attacks such as data tampering, private data leakage, data replication, etc. To this end, in this paper, we propose a new blockchain-based framework for secure task offloading in MEC systems with guaranteed performance in terms of execution delay and energy consumption. First, blockchain technology is introduced as a platform to achieve data confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and privacy of task offloading in MEC. Second, we formulate an integration model of resource allocation and task offloading for a multi-user with multi-task MEC systems to optimize the energy and time cost. This is an NP-hard problem because of the curse-of-dimensionality and dynamic characteristics challenges of the considered scenario. Therefore, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm is developed to derive the close-optimal task offloading decision efficiently. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework is resilient to several task offloading security attacks and it can save about 22.2% and 19.4% of system consumption with respect to the local and edge execution scenarios. Moreover, the benchmark analysis proves that the framework consumes few resources in terms of memory and disk usage, CPU utilization, and transaction throughput.","author":[{"family":"Samy","given":"Ahmed"},{"family":"Elgendy","given":"Ibrahim A."},{"family":"Yu","given":"Haining"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Weizhe"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Hongli"}],"citation-key":"samySecureTaskOffloading2022","container-title":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORK AND SERVICE MANAGEMENT","DOI":"10.1109/TNSM.2022.3190493","ISSN":"1932-4537","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,12]]},"page":"4872-4887","title":"Secure Task Offloading in Blockchain-Enabled Mobile Edge Computing With Deep Reinforcement Learning","type":"article-journal","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"sarwarBlockchainCryptoIntensiveTechnology2020","abstract":"Researchers, critics and industry gurus are agreed that Blockchain is the next big thing. Blockchain is the technology that has shifted the entire paradigm of computer applications in the last decade. The key concept behind the development of Blockchain was to create a chain of data which is immutable, confidential, open- source and located on a de-centralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network. The ownership of Blockchain doesn't belong to a single person or a group but each node on the network therefore, it works without the involvement of any centralized authority. Blockchain was originally designed for cryptocurrency but this technology has been using in many other fields and application like Health, Finance, Banking and IOT etc. Big things come with big challenges so is the case with Blockchain and beside technical challenges, advancement in technology and hardware, Blockchain technology still claims flawless because of cryptographic primitives. This study contributes to review on different cryptographic techniques like ECDSA, SHA-256 and RIPEMD160 used in Blockchain technology and to exemplify its implementation, we choose Bitcoin.","author":[{"family":"Sarwar","given":"Muhammad Imran"},{"family":"Nisar","given":"Kashif"},{"family":"Andleeb","given":"Shama"},{"family":"Noman","given":"Muhammad"}],"citation-key":"sarwarBlockchainCryptoIntensiveTechnology2020","container-title":"EDUCATION EXCELLENCE AND INNOVATION MANAGEMENT: A 2025 VISION TO SUSTAIN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DURING GLOBAL CHALLENGES","editor":[{"family":"Soliman","given":"KS"}],"ISBN":"978-0-9998551-4-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"page":"14803-14809","publisher":"Int Business Informat Management Assoc","title":"Blockchain - A Crypto-Intensive Technology - A Review","type":"paper-conference"},
  {"id":"saurabhNFDLMLightweightNetwork2022","abstract":"In the recent years, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on Internet of Things (IoT) devices have become one of the prime concerns to Internet users around the world. One of the sources of the attacks on IoT ecosystems are botnets. Intruders force IoT devices to become unavailable for its legitimate users by sending large number of messages within a short interval. This study proposes NFDLM, a lightweight and optimised Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) attack detection framework with mutual correlation as feature selection method which produces a superior result when compared with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and simple ANN. Overall, the detection performance achieves approximately 99% accuracy for the detection of attacks from botnets. In this work, we have designed and compared four different models where two are based on ANN and the other two are based on LSTM to detect the attack types of DDoS.","author":[{"family":"Saurabh","given":"Kumar"},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Tanuj"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Uphar"},{"family":"Vyas","given":"O.

  {"id":"sendrosBlockchainApplicationsAgriculture2022","abstract":"Blockchain is a distributed, immutable ledger technology initially developed to secure cryptocurrency transactions. Following its revolutionary use in cryptocurrencies, blockchain solutions are now being proposed to address various problems in different domains, and it is currently one of the most “disruptive” technologies. This paper presents a scoping review of the scientific literature for exploring the current research area of blockchain applications in the agricultural sector. The aim is to identify the service areas of agriculture where blockchain is used, the blockchain technology used, the data stored in it, its combination with external databases, the reason it is used, and the variety of agricultural products, as well as the level of maturity of the respective approaches. The study follows the PRISMA-ScR methodology. The purpose of conducting these scoping reviews is to identify the evidence in this field and clarify the key concepts. The literature search was conducted in April 2021 using Scopus and Google Scholar, and a systematic selection process identified 104 research articles for detailed study. Our findings show that in the field, although still in the early stages, with the majority of the studies in the design phase, several experiments have been conducted, so a significant percentage of the work is in the implementation or piloting phase. Finally, our research shows that the use of blockchain in this domain mainly concerns the integrity of agricultural production records, the monitoring of production steps, and the monitoring of products. However, other varied and remarkable blockchain applications include incentive mechanisms, a circular economy, data privacy, product certification, and reputation systems. This study is the first scoping review in this area, following a formal systematic literature review methodology and answering research questions that have not yet been addressed.","author":[{"family":"Sendros","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Drosatos","given":"George"},{"family":"Efraimidis","given":"Pavlos S."},{"family":"Tsirliganis","given":"Nestor C."}],"citation-key":"sendrosBlockchainApplicationsAgriculture2022","container-title":"APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL","DOI":"10.3390/app12168061","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,8]]},"title":"Blockchain Applications in Agriculture: A Scoping Review","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},

Nevertheless, the signiﬁcant problem still needs to be studied more in-depth that is how to select effective features for accurate malicious trafﬁc detection in the IoT network.

Then, we applied the integrated TOPSIS and Shannon entropy based on a bijective soft set to validate selected features for malicious trafﬁc identiﬁcation in the IoT network.

  {"id":"shafiqAnalyzingIoTAttack2022","abstract":"Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the interconnection via the Internet of computing devices embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data. These devices can be controlled remotely, which makes them susceptible to exploitation or even takeover by an attacker. The lack of security features on many IoT devices makes them easy to access confidential information, issue commands from a distance, or even use the compromised device as part of a DDoS attack against another network. Feature selection is an important part of problem formulation in machine learning. To overcome the above problems, this paper proposes a novel feature selection framework RFS for IoT attack detection using machine learning (ML) techniques. The RFS is based on the concept of effective feature selection and consists of three main stages: feature selection, modeling, and attacks detection. For feature selection, three different models are proposed. Based on these approaches, three different algorithms are proposed. A set of 40 features was included in the model, derived from combinatorial optimization and statistical analysis methods. Our experimental study shows that the proposed frame work significantly improves over state-of-the-art cyberattacks techniques for time series data with outliers.","author":[{"family":"Shafiq","given":"Muhammad"},{"family":"Gu","given":"Zhaoquan"},{"family":"Nazir","given":"Shah"},{"family":"Yadav","given":"Rahul"}],"citation-key":"shafiqAnalyzingIoTAttack2022","container-title":"WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING","DOI":"10.1155/2022/7143054","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,5]]},"title":"Analyzing IoT Attack Feature Association with Threat Actors","type":"article-journal","volume":"2022"},

  {"id":"shaheenApplicationsFederatedLearning2022","abstract":"The federated learning technique (FL) supports the collaborative training of machine learning and deep learning models for edge network optimization. Although a complex edge network with heterogeneous devices having different constraints can affect its performance, this leads to a problem in this area. Therefore, some research can be seen to design new frameworks and approaches to improve federated learning processes. The purpose of this study is to provide an overview of the FL technique and its applicability in different domains. The key focus of the paper is to produce a systematic literature review of recent research studies that clearly describes the adoption of FL in edge networks. The search procedure was performed from April 2020 to May 2021 with a total initial number of papers being 7546 published in the duration of 2016 to 2020. The systematic literature synthesizes and compares the algorithms, models, and frameworks of federated learning. Additionally, we have presented the scope of FL applications in different industries and domains. It has been revealed after careful investigation of studies that 25% of the studies used FL in IoT and edge-based applications and 30% of studies implement the FL concept in the health industry, 10% for NLP, 10% for autonomous vehicles, 10% for mobile services, 10% for recommender systems, and 5% for FinTech. A taxonomy is also proposed on implementing FL for edge networks in different domains. Moreover, another novelty of this paper is that datasets used for the implementation of FL are discussed in detail to provide the researchers an overview of the distributed datasets, which can be used for employing FL techniques. Lastly, this study discusses the current challenges of implementing the FL technique. We have found that the areas of medical AI, IoT, edge systems, and the autonomous industry can adapt the FL in many of its sub-domains; however, the challenges these domains can encounter are statistical heterogeneity, system heterogeneity, data imbalance, resource allocation, and privacy.","author":[{"family":"Shaheen","given":"Momina"},{"family":"Farooq","given":"Muhammad Shoaib"},{"family":"Umer","given":"Tariq"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Byung-Seo"}],"citation-key":"shaheenApplicationsFederatedLearning2022","container-title":"ELECTRONICS","DOI":"10.3390/electronics11040670","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,2]]},"title":"Applications of Federated Learning; Taxonomy, Challenges, and Research Trends","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"shahrakiSurveyFutureDirections2021","abstract":"Many Internet of Things (IoT) networks are created as an overlay over traditional ad-hoc networks such as Zigbee. Moreover, IoT networks can resemble ad-hoc networks over networks that support device-to-device (D2D) communication, e.g., D2D-enabled cellular networks and WiFi-Direct. In these ad-hoc types of IoT networks, efficient topology management is a crucial requirement, and in particular in massive scale deployments. Traditionally, clustering has been recognized as a common approach for topology management in ad-hoc networks, e.g., in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Topology management in WSNs and ad-hoc IoT networks has many design commonalities as both need to transfer data to the destination hop by hop. Thus, WSN clustering techniques can presumably be applied for topology management in ad-hoc IoT networks. This requires a comprehensive study on WSN clustering techniques and investigating their applicability to ad-hoc IoT networks. In this article, we conduct a survey of this field based on the objectives for clustering, such as reducing energy consumption and load balancing, as well as the network properties relevant for efficient clustering in IoT, such as network heterogeneity and mobility. Beyond that, we investigate the advantages and challenges of clustering when IoT is integrated with modern computing and communication technologies such as Blockchain, Fog/Edge computing, and 5G.

  {"id":"shariStateoftheartSolutionsBlockchain2022","abstract":"The concept of a smart city has been introduced to address the shortfalls of urbanization. The aid of technologies in smart cities is envisioned to be the key initiative to mitigate these challenges. However, the technologies exposure imposes challenging issues for the traditional centralized data dissemination schemes in smart cities. Consequently, smart city is undergoing a transition to a decentralized system through the implementation of blockchain technology. This paper presents an extensive survey of blockchain applicability for data dissemination in smart cities. We focus on the components of smart: transportation, healthcare, education, energy and building in smart cities and analyze state-of-the-art work on the integration of these components with blockchain. We discuss the advantages and shortcomings of existing literature and evaluate the performance efficiency and the extent of security and privacy achieved. The analysis leads to our new design of a secure smart city data dissemination framework using blockchain technology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive abstraction in the literature that can be utilized for the designation of future blockchain-smart cities data dissemination schemes with the inclusion of participating entities. Finally, we present open research issues and challenges and discuss future research directions.","author":[{"family":"Shari","given":"Nur Fadhilah Mohd"},{"family":"Malip","given":"Amizah"}],"citation-key":"shariStateoftheartSolutionsBlockchain2022","container-title":"COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS","DOI":"10.1016/j.comcom.2022.03.013","ISSN":"0140-3664","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,1]]},"page":"120-147","title":"State-of-the-art solutions of blockchain technology for data dissemination in smart cities: A comprehensive review","type":"article-journal","volume":"189"},

  {"id":"sharmaArtificialIntelligenceFramework2022","abstract":"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is gaining high popularity in multiple domains targeting different industries. Though initial adoption of AI was thought of as an enabler for automation in industries, but later it presented vast possibilities in innovation and design. Also, with advent of Industry 4.0 standards, AI emerged to play a big role in its adoption across different sectors of industries. Micro, Small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) with limited resources look upon AI as a tool for accelerating their growth. In India, the MSME sector although varies with different States, but dominantly includes textiles, machinery and parts, mining and quarrying, basic metal industries, electrical machinery and apparatus, transport equipment and parts, paper products and printing, food products, chemical and chemical products, leather, wood, rubber, plastic and other non-metallic mineral products, beverages and tobacco products.

  {"id":"sharmaAttacksResourceConstrainedIoT2022","abstract":"An IoT is a complex system of interconnected electronic devices that exchange data over the network. Due to the sensitive nature of the data involved in this new technological paradigm, security measures must be taken with great care. Researchers can better understand the threats and weaknesses of the IoT if attacks are categorized to facilitate the development of a more robust defense system. This study discusses various attacks and statistical data related to IoT. These attacks are divided into two categories: physical and cyber-attacks. Based on the literature review, the authors found that social engineering and DoS are the most common attacks in the physical and cyber categories. This study demonstrates the security solutions inherent to securing the IoT environment. Cryptography, blockchain, software-defined networks, and machine learning techniques were reviewed. They also discussed steps that should be taken to make a safe IoT environment.","author":[{"family":"Sharma","given":"Ravi"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Nonita"}],"citation-key":"sharmaAttacksResourceConstrainedIoT2022","container-title":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE SCIENCE AND COMPUTATIONAL IN℡LIGENCE-IJSSCI","DOI":"10.4018/IJSSCI.310943","ISSN":"1942-9045","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"title":"Attacks on Resource-Constrained IoT Devices and Security Solutions","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"sharmaBuildingBridgingSecurity2022","abstract":"An ever-increasing range of smart, connected internet of things (IoT) devices poses entirely novel security and privacy challenges. Business models that wish to rely on smart product adoption will need to ensure the capability to deliver systems that offer adequate data integrity of sensors with the guarantee of privacy for users. Incorporating smart devices into the mainstream internet poses many security problems, as most internet technologies and protocols have not been developed to support IoT. Strategic support units such as human resources need sufficient technical knowledge about the state of the art to navigate and leverage Industry 4.0 into their practices. Human resources professionals are increasingly asked to take strategic and not operational roles. Using a systematic review method, the authors expose the security and privacy challenges posed by IoTs and conclude with a framework that maps potential solutions to the identified problems. The framework adds to the strategic HR literature and practically helps improve the technical acumen of human resource professionals.","author":[{"family":"Sharma","given":"Nagendra Kumar"},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Vimal"},{"family":"Lai","given":"Kuei-Kuei"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Wen-Kuo"}],"citation-key":"sharmaBuildingBridgingSecurity2022","container-title":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY AND HUMAN INTERACTION","DOI":"10.4018/IJTHI.306225","ISSN":"1548-3908","issue":"7, SI","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"page":"1-15","title":"Building and Bridging Security and Privacy-Related Technical Knowledge Amongst HR Professionals: A Review in the Context of Industry 4.0","type":"article-journal","volume":"18"},

  {"id":"sharmilaBlockchainPoweredVaccine2022","abstract":"Infectious and contagious diseases exist in humanity for many centuries which causes a curb in the growth of the population. Immunization plays a vital role to prevent mortality and morbidity against infectious diseases. COVID-19 pandemic continues to rage the urgency of developing a vaccine that should ensure the safety, efficacy, swift and fair deployment, implementation, and monitoring of vaccines across the globe. In the present context, the vaccine production to immunization campaign is a critical challenge. Therefore, an effective vaccine supply chain mechanism is required to address issues such as counterfeit vaccines, reduce vaccine wastages, and vaccine record fraud. In this paper, a blockchain-enabled vaccine supply chain is proposed to ensure the correctness, transparency, trust, and immutable log and improve the efficiency of vaccine distribution in the cold chain. The uniqueness of the proposed system is to provide distributed system to verify the reliability and efficacy of the vaccine from production to end beneficiaries' feedback about the vaccine. Our proposed system gives a clear view to the users as well as to the healthcare provider about the vaccination and ensures the anticounterfeit vaccine. The proposed system minimizes counterfeit vaccines and records, provides transparent communication between stakeholders in the supply chain, and improves the security of the vaccine supply chain and immutable feedback system about the vaccine.","author":[{"literal":"Sharmila"},{"family":"Bhushan","given":"Shashi"},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Pramod"},{"family":"Garg","given":"Anuj Kumar"},{"family":"Nair","given":"Shyam"}],"citation-key":"sharmilaBlockchainPoweredVaccine2022","container-title":"COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE","DOI":"10.1155/2022/4862742","ISSN":"1748-670X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,10]]},"title":"Blockchain Powered Vaccine Efficacy for Pharma Sector","type":"article-journal","volume":"2022"},

Data management (DM), including data collection, storage, sharing, and computation, plays an essential role in empowering NGWN. However, DM for NGWN faces two significant challenges: stakeholders data cannot be easily managed across different trust domains under a distributed network architecture; and privacy preservation requirements of personal data become more rigorous under new privacy regulations. To explore possible solutions to address the challenges, we first investigate the state-of-the-art architecture designs for DM and emphasize advantages of a blockchain-based DM architecture. Then we summarize existing privacy-preserving techniques in terms of advantages and challenges when being applied to DM. In addition, we review recent privacy regulations with their impacts on DM and discuss the existing solutions with privacy regulation compliance based on blockchain. Finally, we identify further research directions for achieving DM with privacy preservation.","author":[{"family":"Shen","given":"Xuemin Sherman"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Cheng"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Dongxiao"},{"family":"Xue","given":"Liang"},{"family":"Zhuang","given":"Weihua"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Rob"},{"family":"Ying","given":"Bidi"}],"citation-key":"shenDataManagementFuture2021","container-title":"IEEE NETWORK","DOI":"10.1109/MNET.011.2000666","ISSN":"0890-8044","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2]]},"page":"8-15","title":"Data Management for Future Wireless Networks: Architecture, Privacy Preservation, and Regulation","type":"article-journal","volume":"35"},

Talking about the future of the society with imagination, innovation, inspiration, interaction, interconnection and improvement, this is a new paradigm pushing from the pillars of education that needs to be agreed and adapted to the reality of each environment, preventing breaks and digital divides in access to knowledge and technologies that impoverish citizens and therefore to society. A smart city is an urban development vision to integrate multiple information and communication technology and Internet of Things solutions in a secure fashion to manage a city's assets. The smart education is one of the main segments with biggest impact in the smart environment. To cover this high tech new scenario there is a huge demand of new research, profiles and skills. The future framework for smart digital education, leave permanently redefined from the impact of new technologies, experiences and case studies from a more interconnected perspective. AR is the integration of digital information with the user's environment in real time. Unlike VR, which creates a totally artificial environment, AR enhanced by IoT Data uses the existing environment and overlays new information on top of it. This new technology blurs the line between what is real and what is computer-generated by enhancing what we see, hear, feel and smell. The present paper aims to present the current state of the art of AR used in smart digital education, the most relevant opportunities and technical limitations as well as the challenges of building AR applications enhanced by the IoT Data and AI features with the risks and rewards. A considerable amount of research has been focused on AR usage in education. However, the educational advantages and related utilities of AR have only recently been explored in detail. Therefore, a review of advantages and challenges reported in research studies on AR technology in education can usefully suggest both best practices and areas in which to invest future research and development, so that this technology may be employed to its maximum capacity. The paper is structured as follows. After a short introduction into the concepts of smart education and AR, Section 2 presents in brief the methodology used. Section 3 discusses converging of the mixed reality technology with the IoT. Section 4 outlines the main findings of the global AR in education market research analysis, where the analysts predict the CAGR growth of more than 82% by 2021. Section 5 outlines the top three trends in AR that impact education in terms of AR textbooks, AR gaming and student-centric smart digital environments. Section 6 is focused on advantages, disadvantages and challenges of using the augmented reality for education. In Conclusions are drawn future research directions.","author":[{"family":"Shoikova","given":"E."},{"family":"Nikolov","given":"R."},{"family":"Kovatcheva","given":"E."}],"citation-key":"shoikovaSMARTDIGITALEDUCATION2018","collection-title":"INTED Proceedings","container-title":"12TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE (INTED)","editor":[{"family":"Chova","given":"LG"},{"family":"Martinez","given":"AL"},{"family":"Torres","given":"IC"}],"ISBN":"978-84-697-9480-7","ISSN":"2340-1079","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"page":"5861-5871","title":"SMART DIGITAL EDUCATION ENHANCED BY AR AND IOT DATA","type":"paper-conference"},
  {"id":"shresthaEvolutionV2XCommunication2020","abstract":"With the rapid evolution in wireless communications and autonomous vehicles, intelligent and autonomous vehicles will be launched soon. Vehicle to Everything (V2X) communications provides driving safety, traffic efficiency, and road information in real-time in vehicular networks. V2X has evolved by integrating cellular 5G and New Radio (NR) access technology in V2X communications (i.e., 5G NR V2X); it can fulfill the ever-evolving vehicular application, communication, and service demands of connected vehicles, such as ultra-low latency, ultra-high bandwidth, ultra-high reliability, and security. However, with the increasing number of intelligent and autonomous vehicles and their safety requirements, there is a backlash in deployment and management because of scalability, poor security and less flexibility. Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) plays a significant role in bringing cloud services closer to vehicular nodes, which reduces the scalability and flexibility issues. In addition, blockchain has evolved as an effective technology enabler to solve several security, privacy, and networking issues faced by the current 5G-based MEC systems in vehicular networks. Blockchain can be integrated as a strong security mechanism for securing and managing 5G V2X along with MEC. In this survey, we discuss, in detail, state-of-the-art V2X, its evolution based on cellular 5G technology and non-cellular 802.11bd. We investigate the integration of blockchain in 5G-based MEC vehicular networks for security, privacy protection, and content caching. We present the issues and challenges in existing edge computing and 5G V2X and, then, we shed some light on future research directions in these integrated and emerging technologies.","author":[{"family":"Shrestha","given":"Rakesh"},{"family":"Nam","given":"Seung Yeob"},{"family":"Bajracharya","given":"Rojeena"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Shiho"}],"citation-key":"shresthaEvolutionV2XCommunication2020","container-title":"ELECTRONICS","DOI":"10.3390/electronics9091338","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,9]]},"title":"Evolution of V2X Communication and Integration of Blockchain for Security Enhancements","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},

It was found that most of the research focus is on the provision of solutions for low- to medium-income countries that are still lagging behind in reducing maternal and child mortality rates even though there has been an advancement in terms of Industry 4.0 technology use. The research was largely quantitative in nature with models and frameworks developed as opposed to prototypes. It mainly combined the Internet of things (IoT) with Cloud computing and Big data analytics (BDA). Artificial intelligence (AI) in maternal healthcare was similarly trending. Only one paper focused on the use of blockchain in facilitating health information exchange of maternal records. Recommendations for policy and a future research agenda are made.

  {"id":"siddiqiAgileApproachIdentify2021","abstract":"Detecting intrusion in network traffic has remained a problematic task for years. Progress in the field of machine learning is paving the way for enhancing intrusion detection systems. Due to this progress intrusion detection has become an integral part of network security. Intrusion detection has achieved high detection accuracy with the help of supervised machine learning methods. A key factor in enhancing the performance of supervised classifiers is how data is augmented for training the classification model. Data in real-world networks or publicly available datasets are not always normally (Gaussian) distributed. Instead, the distributions of variables are more likely to be skewed. To achieve a high detection rate, data normalization or transformation plays an important role for machine learning-based intrusion detection systems. Several methods are available to normalize the attributes of the data before training a classification model. However, opting for the most suitable normalization technique is still a questionable task. In this paper, a statistical method is proposed that can identify the most suitable normalization method for the dataset. The normalization method identified by the proposed approach gives the highest accuracy for an intrusion detection system. To highlight the efficiency of the proposed method, five different datasets were used with two different feature selection methods. The datasets belong to both Internet of things and traditional network environments. The proposed method is also able to identify hybrid normalizations to achieve even improved intrusion detection results.","author":[{"family":"Siddiqi","given":"Murtaza Ahmed"},{"family":"Pak","given":"Wooguil"}],"citation-key":"siddiqiAgileApproachIdentify2021","container-title":"IEEE ACCESS","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3118361","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"page":"137494-137513","title":"An Agile Approach to Identify Single and Hybrid Normalization for Enhancing Machine Learning-Based Network Intrusion Detection","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"singhIoTBasedInformation2018","abstract":"Underground mining operations require robust and efficient communication like other industrial enterprises. Communication in the mining industry is the most critical factor to ensure the safety and security of the underground working environment. A robust IT communication infrastructure in underground mining will enhance safety and provide information in real-time which can result in a quick response to some fatal situation. Communication technologies that are capable of bearing the rough terrain and extreme environment inside a mine and between the surface and underground workstations is a critical factor for the monitoring of various underground mining operations remotely. Internet of Things (IoT) can play a massive role in the mining operations to improve the safety of the workers with enhanced productivity. Wireless communication, which is a part of IoT setup, is already playing a vital role in underground mine communication (UMC). Recently, IoT with its building blocks has been introduced to deploy and automate the operation of `self-advancing goaf edge support (SAGES)' systems in an attempt to explore the possibility of the technology for real-time performance monitoring of support system including the behaviour of overlying roof strata in underground coal mines. The machine helps in supporting the roof of the mines during mining the coal. This paper presents a conceptual framework for implementation of IoT to make this underground support system smarter i.e. Smart-SAGES. The taxonomy of security challenges in UMC IoT combination has been described in detail in order to identify clear security goals. The blockchain based system seems to be a promising technology for the mining industry as it may help in curbing the penetration and disruption of cyber-attacks due to heterogeneous devices and distributed network. Various open issues in UMC have also been outlined. Vulnerabilities like information disclosure and Denial-of-Service attack (DoS attack) were discovered during the threat and risk analysis on the SAGES data logger. The SAGES falls into information generation block of IoT ecosystem. Therefore, it is advisable to incorporate the security by design approach from the initial phase of the development.

However, it also makes a large number of cyber-attacks possible because most IoT devices have very limited resources and cannot perform ordinary intrusion detection systems. How to implement efficient and lightweight IDS in IoT environments is a critically important and challenging task. Several detection systems have been implemented on Raspberry Pi, but most of them are signature-based and only allow limited rules. In this study, a lightweight IDS based on machine learning is implemented on a Raspberry Pi. To make the system lightweight, a correlation-based feature selection algorithm is applied to significantly reduce the number of features and a lightweight classifier is utilized. The performance of our system is examined in detail and the experimental result indicates that our system is lightweight and has a much higher detection speed with almost no sacrifice of detection accuracy. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","author":[{"family":"Soe","given":"Y.

It was said that most of the attacks in IoT environments are botnet-based attacks. Many security weaknesses still exist on the IoT devices because most of them have not enough memory and computational resource for robust security mechanisms. Moreover, many existing rule-based detection systems can be circumvented by attackers. In this study, we proposed a machine learning (ML)-based botnet attack detection framework with sequential detection architecture. An efficient feature selection approach is adopted to implement a lightweight detection system with a high performance. The overall detection performance achieves around 99% for the botnet attack detection using three different ML algorithms, including artificial neural network (ANN), J48 decision tree, and Naive Bayes. The experiment result indicates that the proposed architecture can effectively detect botnet-based attacks, and also can be extended with corresponding sub-engines for new kinds of attacks.","author":[{"family":"Soe","given":"Yan Naung"},{"family":"Feng","given":"Yaokai"},{"family":"Santosa","given":"Paulus Insap"},{"family":"Hartanto","given":"Rudy"},{"family":"Sakurai","given":"Kouichi"}],"citation-key":"soeMachineLearningBasedIoTBotnet2020","container-title":"SENSORS","DOI":"10.3390/s20164372","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,8]]},"title":"Machine Learning-Based IoT-Botnet Attack Detection with Sequential Architecture dagger","type":"article-journal","volume":"20"},

However, unsolved security challenges from their enlarged accessibility and connectivity have delayed realizing such systems. To address the emerging issues, the blockchain technology can be adopted to utilize its inherent generic security capabilities. However, research regarding the use of blockchain in manufacturing systems has only begun in the past few years while their research findings have been disseminated through a wide range of different outlets. This paper presents a literature review covering how manufacturing systems can adopt the blockchain technology while maintaining their production capacity, flexibility, and costefficiency. In addition to the survey, five categories of manufacturing systems striving to achieve the goal of Industry 4.0 are defined to provide a system model-based analysis. Also, a technology roadmap-that visualizes the chronological history of the technology-has been adopted to present the research trend and identify opportunities for future studies.","author":[{"family":"Song","given":"Jinwoo"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jinbo"},{"family":"Moon","given":"Young B."}],"citation-key":"songBLOCKCHAINAPPLICATIONSMANUFACTURING2021","container-title":"PROCEEDINGS OF ASME 2021 INTERNATIONAL MECHANICAL ENGINEERING CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION (IMECE2021), VOL 2B","ISBN":"978-0-7918-8556-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"publisher":"Amer Soc Mech Engineers","title":"BLOCKCHAIN APPLICATIONS OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS: A SURVEY","type":"paper-conference"},
  {"id":"songBlockchainSmartManufacturing2022","abstract":"Purpose Smart manufacturing is the prime gripper for the transformation and upgrading of the manufacturing industry. Smart manufacturing systems (SMSs) largely determine how smart manufacturing evolves in technical and organizational dimensions and how it realizes values in products, production or services. SMSs are growing rapidly and receiving tons of attention from academic research and industrial practice. However, the development of SMSs is still in its fancy, and many issues wait to be identified and solved, such as single point failures, low transparency and ineffective resource sharing. Blockchain, an emerging technology deriving from Bitcoin, is competent to aid SMSs to conquer troubles due to its decentralization, traceability, trackability, disintermediation, auditability and etc. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the blockchain applications in SMSs, seek out the challenges faced by blockchain-enabled SMSs (BSMSs) and provide referable research directions and ideas. Design/methodology/approach A comprehensive literature review as a survey is conducted in this paper. The survey starts by introducing blockchain concepts, followed by the descriptions of a literature review method and the blockchain applications throughout the product life cycle in SMSs. Then, the key issues and challenges confronting BSMSs are discussed and some possible research directions are also proposed. It finally presents qualitative and quantitative descriptions of BSMSs, along with some conclusions and implications. Findings The findings of this paper present a deep understanding about the current status and challenges of blockchain adoption in SMSs. Furthermore, this paper provides a brand new thinking for future research. Originality/value This paper minutely analyzes the impacts that blockchain exerts on SMSs in view of the product life cycle, and proposes using the complexity science thinking to deal with BSMSs qualitatively and quantitatively, including tackling the current major problems BSMSs face. This research can serve as a foundation for future theoretical studies and enterprise practice.","author":[{"family":"Song","given":"Zhiting"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Jianhua"}],"citation-key":"songBlockchainSmartManufacturing2022","container-title":"CHINESE MANAGEMENT STUDIES","DOI":"10.1108/CMS-04-2021-0152","ISSN":"1750-614X","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,25]]},"page":"1224-1253","title":"Blockchain for smart manufacturing systems: a survey","type":"article-journal","volume":"16"},

This paper provides a state-of-the-art overview of these technologies and illustrates their functionality and performance, with special attention to the tradeoff among resources, latency, privacy and energy consumption. Finally, the paper provides a vision for integrating these enabling technologies in energy-efficient iIoTe and a roadmap to address the open research challenges.","author":[{"family":"Soret","given":"Beatriz"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Lam D."},{"family":"Seeger","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Broring","given":"Arne"},{"family":"Ben Issaid","given":"Chaouki"},{"family":"Samarakoon","given":"Sumudu"},{"family":"El Gabli","given":"Anis"},{"family":"Kulkarni","given":"Vivek"},{"family":"Bennis","given":"Mehdi"},{"family":"Popovski","given":"Petar"}],"citation-key":"soretLearningComputingTrustworthiness2022","container-title":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GREEN COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING","DOI":"10.1109/TGCN.2021.3138792","ISSN":"2473-2400","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,3]]},"page":"629-644","title":"Learning, Computing, and Trustworthiness in Intelligent IoT Environments: Performance-Energy Tradeoffs","type":"article-journal","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"srivastavaImperativeRoleTechnology2022","abstract":"According to sustainable development goals, the construction industry is one of the vital industries that can build resilient and sustainable infrastructure for human settlements. As the traditional approaches in the construction industry are causing distinct challenges including environmental pollution and excess energy usage, however, the integration of emerging technologies will assist us to reduce the impact and also enhance the activities in the construction industry. Motivated by the facts, this study aims to address the significance of automation in the construction industry with distinct emerging technologies like the Internet of things (IoT), automation, radio frequency identification (RFID), building information modeling (BIM), augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR). The large amount of data generated from the IoT, RFID, BIM, and AR/VR provided an opportunity for big data and artificial intelligence (AI) to extract meaningful insights related to the events in the construction industry. Furthermore, edge and fog computing technology encourages us to implement AI at the edge network for analytics at the end of the edge device. Based on the above analysis, the article discussed recommendations that could assist in further enhancement and implementation of automation in the construction industry.

  {"id":"stachAssessmentTreatmentPrivacy2022","abstract":"The ability to capture and quantify any aspect of daily life via sensors, enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT), data have become one of the most important resources of the 21st century. However, the high value of data also renders data an appealing target for criminals. Two key protection goals when dealing with data are therefore to maintain their permanent availability and to ensure their integrity. Blockchain technology provides a means of data protection that addresses both of these objectives. On that account, blockchains are becoming increasingly popular for the management of critical data. As blockchains are operated in a decentralized manner, they are not only protected against failures, but it is also ensured that neither party has sole control over the managed data. Furthermore, blockchains are immutable and tamper-proof data stores, whereby data integrity is guaranteed. While these properties are preferable from a data security perspective, they also pose a threat to privacy and confidentiality, as data cannot be concealed, rectified, or deleted once they are added to the blockchain. In this paper, we therefore investigate which features of the blockchain pose an inherent privacy threat when dealing with personal or confidential data. To this end, we consider to what extent blockchains are in compliance with applicable data protection laws, namely the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Based on our identified key issues, we assess which concepts and technical measures can be leveraged to address these issues in order to create a privacy-by-design blockchain system.","author":[{"family":"Stach","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Gritti","given":"Clementine"},{"family":"Przytarski","given":"Dennis"},{"family":"Mitschang","given":"Bernhard"}],"citation-key":"stachAssessmentTreatmentPrivacy2022","container-title":"APPLIED COMPUTING REVIEW","DOI":"10.1145/3477314.3506986","ISSN":"1559-6915","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,9]]},"page":"5-24","title":"Assessment and Treatment of Privacy Issues in Blockchain Systems","type":"article-journal","volume":"22"},

As the IIoT expands to various aspects of the Industry, devices from different industrial domains need to collaborate without compromising the privacy and security of the data being exchanged and stored. The biggest challenge IIoT is going to face is security and privacy. Any attack against an industrial environment can adversely affect human life, the quality of products, and permanent damage the machines for an extended period. Authentication is considered the first security control in IIoT system to ensure that the right user accesses the right resources. Blockchain is a distributed public ledger that contains blocks of tamper-proof data. Blockchain-based cybersecurity platforms can protect the connected devices in an IIoT platform using digital identities and can be used to authenticate the participating entities. A blockchain enabled IIoT platform has a decentralized infrastructure making it impossible for hackers to attack a network because all participants are immediately notified of any alterations.

  {"id":"sunInternetBehaviorsSurvey2023","abstract":"The Internet of Behavior (IoB) is a research theme that aims to analyze human behavior data on the Internet from the perspective of behavioral psychology, obtain insights about human behavior, and better understand the intention behind the behavior. In this way, the IoB can predict human behavioral trends in the future and even change human behavior, which can provide more convenience for human life. With the increasing prosperity of the Internet of Things (IoT), more and more behavior-related data is collected on the Internet by connected devices such as sensors. People and behavior are connected through the extension of the IoT-the IoB. Presently, the IoB has gradually been applied to our lives, but it is still in its early stages, and many opportunities and challenges are emerging. This article provides an in-depth overview of the fundamental aspects of the IoB: 1) we introduce the development process and research status of the IoB from the perspective of the IoT; 2) we propose the characteristics of the IoB and define its development direction in terms of three aspects: a) real time; b) autonomy; and c) reliability; 3) we provide a comprehensive summary of the current applications of the IoB, including specific discussions in five scenarios that give an overview of the application status of the IoB; and 4) we discuss the challenges of the IoB's development and its future directions, which hopefully will bring some progress to the IoB. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey paper on the IoB. We hope that this in-depth review can provide some useful directions for more productive research in related fields.","author":[{"family":"Sun","given":"Jiayi"},{"family":"Gan","given":"Wensheng"},{"family":"Chao","given":"Han-Chieh"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Philip S."},{"family":"Ding","given":"Weiping"}],"citation-key":"sunInternetBehaviorsSurvey2023","container-title":"IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL","DOI":"10.1109/JIOT.2023.3247594","ISSN":"2327-4662","issue":"13","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,1]]},"page":"11117-11134","title":"Internet of Behaviors: A Survey","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},

In addition, challenges such as security, energy consumption, storage space, bandwidth, lack of mobility support, and lack of location awareness have made this problem more challenging. Expanding applications such as online gaming, Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), metaverse, e-health, and the Internet of Things (IoT) have brought up new paradigms for processing big data. Some of the paradigms that have emerged in the last decade are trying to alleviate cloud computing problems jointly. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and Fog Computing (FC) are the most critical techniques that serve the IoT. One of the common points of the above paradigms is the offloading of IoT tasks. This paper reviews machine learning-based computation offloading mechanisms in the edge and fog environment. This review covers three significant areas of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. We discuss various performance metrics, tools, and case studies and analyze their advantages and disadvantages. We systematically elaborate on open issues and research challenges that are crucial for the next decade.","author":[{"family":"Taheri-abed","given":"Sanaz"},{"family":"Moghadam","given":"Amir Masoud Eftekhari"},{"family":"Rezvani","given":"Mohammad Hossein"}],"citation-key":"taheri-abedMachineLearningbasedComputation2023","container-title":"CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS","DOI":"10.1007/s10586-023-04100-z","ISSN":"1386-7857","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,10]]},"page":"3113-3144","title":"Machine learning-based computation offloading in edge and fog: a systematic review","type":"article-journal","volume":"26"},
  {"id":"tajIoTbasedSupplyChain2023","abstract":"Supply Chain Management (SCM) consists of handling and optimizing all the facets of the supply chain process of goods and services. Modern SCM is reaping the benefits from the emerging and growing Internet of Things (IoT) field. IoT technology can automate and digitalize the supply chain processes to get maximum operational efficiencies by reducing operating costs. The mass proliferation of IoT devices has revolutionized supply chains. IoT devices in the supply chain process track and trace shipments using the latest real-time monitoring technologies, including GPS. IoT devices are also used for asset management using NFC technology and RFID tags. Overall, IoT devices are used in almost every stage of the supply chain process. Research on IoT-based SCM is still in the growing phase. A lot of technical work is currently being published on IoT-based SCM, but a few Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) have been found for IoT-based SCM. The holistic view of IoT-based SCM with detailed analysis is still not reported in any review. This paper addresses this knowledge gap by presenting an SLR on IoT-based SCM with a detailed analysis of IoT-based SCM from 2018 to 2022. This review covers the aspects of IoT-based SCM, such as application domains, technologies, sensors, and devices used to implement IoT-based SCM systems. The SLR findings will assist future researchers and practitioners interested in IoT-based SCM by offering an in-depth study of the literature on IoT-based SCM, including helpful insights on challenges, benefits, and economic and business implications.","author":[{"family":"Taj","given":"Soonh"},{"family":"Imran","given":"Ali Shariq"},{"family":"Kastrati","given":"Zenun"},{"family":"Daudpota","given":"Sher Muhammad"},{"family":"Memon","given":"Raheel Ahmed"},{"family":"Ahmed","given":"Javed"}],"citation-key":"tajIoTbasedSupplyChain2023","container-title":"INTERNET OF THINGS","DOI":"10.1016/j.iot.2023.100982","ISSN":"2543-1536","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,12]]},"title":"IoT-based supply chain management: A systematic literature review","type":"article-journal","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"tambarePerformanceMeasurementSystem2022","abstract":"The birth of mass production started in the early 1900s. The manufacturing industries were transformed from mechanization to digitalization with the help of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Now, the advancement of ICT and the Internet of Things has enabled smart manufacturing or Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 refers to the various technologies that are transforming the way we work in manufacturing industries such as Internet of Things, cloud, big data, AI, robotics, blockchain, autonomous vehicles, enterprise software, etc. Additionally, the Industry 4.0 concept refers to new production patterns involving new technologies, manufacturing factors, and workforce organization. It changes the production process and creates a highly efficient production system that reduces production costs and improves product quality. The concept of Industry 4.0 is relatively new; there is high uncertainty, lack of knowledge and limited publication about the performance measurement and quality management with respect to Industry 4.0. Conversely, manufacturing companies are still struggling to understand the variety of Industry 4.0 technologies. Industrial standards are used to measure performance and manage the quality of the product and services. In order to fill this gap, our study focuses on how the manufacturing industries use different industrial standards to measure performance and manage the quality of the product and services. This paper reviews the current methods, industrial standards, key performance indicators (KPIs) used for performance measurement systems in data-driven Industry 4.0, and the case studies to understand how smart manufacturing companies are taking advantage of Industry 4.0. Furthermore, this article discusses the digitalization of quality called Quality 4.0, research challenges and opportunities in data-driven Industry 4.0 are discussed.","author":[{"family":"Tambare","given":"Parkash"},{"family":"Meshram","given":"Chandrashekhar"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Cheng-Chi"},{"family":"Ramteke","given":"Rakesh Jagdish"},{"family":"Imoize","given":"Agbotiname Lucky"}],"citation-key":"tambarePerformanceMeasurementSystem2022","container-title":"SENSORS","DOI":"10.3390/s22010224","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1]]},"title":"Performance Measurement System and Quality Management in Data-Driven Industry 4.0: A Review","type":"article-journal","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"tangeSystematicSurveyIndustrial2020","abstract":"A key application of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm lies within industrial contexts. Indeed, the emerging Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), commonly referred to as Industry 4.0, promises to revolutionize production and manufacturing through the use of large numbers of networked embedded sensing devices, and the combination of emerging computing technologies, such as Fog/Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence. The IIoT is characterized by an increased degree of inter-connectivity, which not only creates opportunities for the industries that adopt it, but also for cyber-criminals. Indeed, IoT security currently represents one of the major obstacles that prevent the widespread adoption of IIoT technology. Unsurprisingly, such concerns led to an exponential growth of published research over the last few years. To get an overview of the field, we deem it important to systematically survey the academic literature so far, and distill from it various security requirements as well as their popularity. This paper consists of two contributions: our primary contribution is a systematic review of the literature over the period 2011-2019 on IIoT Security, focusing in particular on the security requirements of the IIoT. Our secondary contribution is a reflection on how the relatively new paradigm of Fog computing can be leveraged to address these requirements, and thus improve the security of the IIoT.","author":[{"family":"Tange","given":"Koen"},{"family":"De Donno","given":"Michele"},{"family":"Fafoutis","given":"Xenofon"},{"family":"Dragoni","given":"Nicola"}],"citation-key":"tangeSystematicSurveyIndustrial2020","container-title":"IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS AND TUTORIALS","DOI":"10.1109/COMST.2020.3011208","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"page":"2489-2520","title":"A Systematic Survey of Industrial Internet of Things Security: Requirements and Fog Computing Opportunities","type":"article-journal","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"tanRecentTechnologiesSecurity2021","abstract":"The inherent complexities of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) architecture make its security and privacy issues becoming critically challenging. Numerous surveys have been published to review IoT security issues and challenges. The studies gave a general overview of IIoT security threats or a detailed analysis that explicitly focuses on specific technologies. However, recent studies fail to analyze the gap between security requirements of these technologies and their deployed countermeasure in the industry recently. Whether recent industry countermeasure is still adequate to address the security challenges of IIoT environment are questionable. This article presents a comprehensive survey of IIoT security and provides insight into today's industry countermeasure, current research proposals and ongoing challenges. We classify IIoT technologies into the four-layer security architecture, examine the deployed countermeasure based on CIA+ security requirements, report the deficiencies of today's countermeasure, and highlight the remaining open issues and challenges. As no single solution can fix the entire IIoT ecosystem, IIoT security architecture with a higher abstraction level using the bottom-up approach is needed. Moving towards a data-centric approach that assures data protection whenever and wherever it goes could potentially solve the challenges of industry deployment.","author":[{"family":"Tan","given":"Soo Fun"},{"family":"Samsudin","given":"Azman"}],"citation-key":"tanRecentTechnologiesSecurity2021","container-title":"SENSORS","DOI":"10.3390/s21196647","issue":"19","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,10]]},"title":"Recent Technologies, Security Countermeasure and Ongoing Challenges of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT): A Survey","type":"article-journal","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"tavanaIoTbasedEnterpriseResource2020","abstract":"In today's highly competitive markets, organizations can create a competitive advantage through the successful implementation of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. ERP works with different technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT uses a unique Internet protocol to identify, control, and transfer data to individuals as well as databases. The data is collected through IoT, stored on the cloud, and extracted and managed in through ERP. In this study, we review the challenges, open issues, applications, and architecture of the IoT-based ERP. For this purpose, we review and analyze the latest IoT-related articles to present the unique features of the IoT and discuss its impact on ERP. The results show sensors and devices connected to the Internet can manage the stored data processed in the cloud through ERP without human intervention. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities in the relationship between ERP and the IoT risen by the introduction of the cloud. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

  {"id":"tengRecentAdvancesIndustrial2021","abstract":"Data-driven models for industrial energy savings heavily rely on sensor data, experimentation data and knowledge-based data. This work reveals that too much research attention was invested in making data-driven models, as supposed to ensuring the quality of industrial data. Furthermore, the true challenge within the In-dustry 4.0 is with data communication and infrastructure problems, not so significantly on developing modelling techniques. Current methods and data infrastructures for industrial energy savings were comprehensively reviewed to showcase the potential for a more accurate and effective digital twin-based infrastructure for the industry. With a few more development in enabling technologies such as 5G developments, Internet of Things (IoT) standardization, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain 3.0 utilization, it is but a matter of time that the industry will transition towards the digital twin-based approach. Global government efforts and policies are already inclining towards leveraging better industrial energy efficiencies and energy savings. This provides a promising future for the development of a digital twin-based energy-saving system in the industry. Foreseeing some potential challenges, this paper also discusses the importance of symbiosis between researchers and industrialists to transition from traditional industry towards a digital twin-based energy-saving industry. The novelty of this work is the current context of industrial energy savings was extended towards cutting-edge technologies for Industry 4.0. Furthermore, this work proposes to standardize and modularize industrial data infrastructure for smart energy savings. This work also serves as a concise guideline for researchers and industrialists who are looking to implement advanced energy-saving systems.","author":[{"family":"Teng","given":"Sin Yong"},{"family":"Tous","given":"Michal"},{"family":"Leong","given":"Wei Dong"},{"family":"How","given":"Bing Shen"},{"family":"Lam","given":"Hon Loong"},{"family":"Masa","given":"Vitezslav"}],"citation-key":"tengRecentAdvancesIndustrial2021","container-title":"RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS","DOI":"10.1016/j.rser.2020.110208","ISSN":"1364-0321","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1]]},"title":"Recent advances on industrial data-driven energy savings: Digital twins and infrastructures","type":"article-journal","volume":"135"},

It is also known as the core system leading a new round of industrial technology reform in the world. By accurately mapping the entities, behaviors and interactive environment in the objective physical world to the information space, real-time processing and feedback back to the physical space, CPS can solve the problems of analysis and modeling, decision optimization and uncertainty processing of complex systems from a system perspective and different levels. This paper analyzes the key technologies and difficult bottlenecks of CPS from its architecture, design and development process, discusses the supportive relationship between CPS and cutting-edge technologies such as edge cloud collaborative computing, digital twins, artificial intelligence and blockchain, and summarizes the research status of CPS in four application fields: industrial production, energy and electricity, traffic and medical health. Finally, the future technical development of CPS is prospected. It is hoped to provide reference for experts and scholars in CPS fields, and provide technical support for China's industrial scientific and technological revolution and intelligence transformation.","author":[{"family":"Ting","given":"Yang"},{"family":"Yachuang","given":"Liu"},{"family":"Yuzhe","given":"Liu"},{"family":"Chengshan","given":"Wang"}],"citation-key":"tingReviewCyberPhysicalSystem2021","container-title":"JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY","DOI":"10.11999/JEIT211135","ISSN":"1009-5896","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,12]]},"page":"3393-3406","title":"Review on Cyber-Physical System: Technology Analysis and Trends","type":"article-journal","volume":"43"},

The need to develop smart P2P systems capable of verifying, securing, monitoring, and analyzing agricultural data is leading to thinking about building blockchain-based IoT systems in precision agriculture. Blockchain plays the role of pivotal in replacing the classical methods of storing, sorting and sharing agricultural data into a more reliable, immutable, transparent and decentralized manner. In precision farming, the combination of the Internet of Things and the blockchain will move us from only smart farms only to the internet of smart farms and add more control in supply-chains networks. The result of this combination will lead to more autonomy and intelligence in managing precision agriculture in more efficient and optimized ways. This paper exhibits a comprehensive survey on the importance of integrating both blockchain and IoT in developing smart applications in precision agriculture. The paper also proposed novel blockchain models that can be used as important solutions for major challenges in IoT-based precision agricultural systems. In addition, the study reviewed and clearly discussed the main functions and strengths of the common blockchain platforms used in managing various sub-sectors in precision agriculture such as crops, livestock grazing, and food supply chain. Finally, the paper discussed some of the security and privacy challenges, and blockchain-open issues that obstacles developing blockchain-IoT systems in precision agriculture.","author":[{"family":"Torky","given":"Mohamed"},{"family":"Hassanein","given":"Aboul Ella"}],"citation-key":"torkyIntegratingBlockchainInternet2020","container-title":"COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE","DOI":"10.1016/j.compag.2020.105476","ISSN":"0168-1699","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11]]},"title":"Integrating blockchain and the internet of things in precision agriculture: Analysis, opportunities, and challenges","type":"article-journal","volume":"178"},
  {"id":"torres-carrionIoTSecurityIssues2022","abstract":"The large number of devices connected to the Internet have caused the traditional cloud computing model to become a bottleneck. In recent years, this has motivated the advancement of edge computing or fog computing, which provides analysis and processing capabilities closer to where the data is generated. Due to the large amount of information that will be exposed in Edge Computing, the need arises to study security in depth in the scenarios proposed by these new paradigms; For this reason, the present work shows the results of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), in which, of the 50 studies analyzed, 24 security problems were identified, which are identified as attacks that mostly affect the user. IoT and are also the most frequent in Edge Computing, some of these are: DoS and DDoS attack, manin-the-middle attack, phishing attack, replay attacks, collusion attack, physical manipulation attack, fake node injection and device cloning; In the same way, it was determined what: knowledge of the location, geographical distribution, decentralized architecture, mobility support, scalability and reduced energy consumption, are characteristics that contribute to the occurrence of security attacks.","author":[{"family":"Torres-Carrion","given":"Hernan"},{"family":"Solano-Chamba","given":"Cecivel"},{"family":"Narvaez-Guillen","given":"Cristian"},{"family":"Cueva-Hurtado","given":"Mario"}],"citation-key":"torres-carrionIoTSecurityIssues2022","collection-title":"Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies","container-title":"2022 17TH IBERIAN CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES (CISTI)","editor":[{"family":"Rocha","given":"A"},{"family":"Bordel","given":"B"},{"family":"Penalvo","given":"FG"},{"family":"Goncalves","given":"R"}],"ISBN":"978-989-33-3436-2","ISSN":"2166-0727","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"publisher":"Univ Politecnica Madrid; IEEE SMC Portugal Chapter; Informat & Technol Management Assoc; IEEE Spain Sect; IEEE SMC Spain Chapter; IEEE SMC France Chapter; IEEE SMC Italy Chapter; AISTI","title":"IoT security issues in the context of Edge Computing: A Systematic Review of Literature","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"ugochukwuBlockchainBasedIoTEnabledSystem2022","abstract":"As the global logistics business expands as a result of the industrial 4.0 revolution, logistics operations continue to evolve as new technologies such as IoT, cloud, and big data are deployed. These IoT devices improve the logistics function by boosting real-time product tracking, improved data collection, smart storage of logistics data, etc. Some of these new technologies present an avenue for cyberattacks on these logistics systems due to their centralized database structure. Logistics operations entail the exchange of private consumer information (name, address, phone number, and bank account information) as well as product information amongst logistics stakeholders (manufacturers, suppliers, transporters, and customers). And the engagement of so many logistics stakeholders creates privacy and security issues for the private information because customer information, as well as product details, are transferred and shared across different logistical stakeholders during the logistics process. It faces unwanted access, which could lead to fraud or the creation of counterfeit products by a bad actor in the system. All of these challenges are significant because logistics data integrity is important for customer satisfaction. The deployment of Blockchain innovation will address these challenges with the application of its special feature such as immutability, efficient cryptography, and distributed decentralized storage system. In this paper, we highlighted the technology that enables smart logistics and reviewed smart logistics, Blockchain, and IoT in logistics; we present the significance of integrating Blockchain and IoT in logistics. We proposed a Blockchain-based IoT-enabled system framework for secure and efficient logistics management where logistics data can be captured with the use of IoT sensors, and we also designed and describe the sequence diagram for secured communication between the logistics stakeholder through a smart contract. In conclusion, Blockchain can provide security to logistics data and enhance operational efficiency with its key features.","author":[{"family":"Ugochukwu","given":"Nwosu Anthony"},{"family":"Goyal","given":"S.

  {"id":"ullahConceptualFrameworkBlockchain2023","abstract":"Blockchains-based smart contracts are disrupting the smart real estate sector of the smart cities. The current study explores the literature focused on blockchain smart contracts in smart real estate and proposes a conceptual framework for its adoption in smart cities. Based on a systematic review method, the literature published between 2000 and 2020 is explored and analyzed. From the literature, ten key aspects of the blockchain smart contracts are highlighted that are grouped into six layers for adopting the smart contracts in smart real estate. The decentralized application and its interactions with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) are presented to show the development of a smart contract that can be used for blockchain smart contracts in real estate. Further, a detailed design and interaction mechanism are highlighted for the real estate owners and users as parties to a smart contract. A list of functions for initiating, creating, modifying, or terminating a smart contract is presented along with a stepwise procedure for establishing and terminating smart contracts. The current study can help the users enjoy a more immersive, user-friendly, and visualized contracting process, whereas the owners, property technologies (Proptech) companies, and real estate agents can enjoy more business and sales. This can help disrupt traditional real estate and transform it into smart real estate in line with industry 4.0 requirements.","author":[{"family":"Ullah","given":"Fahim"},{"family":"Al-Turjman","given":"Fadi"}],"citation-key":"ullahConceptualFrameworkBlockchain2023","container-title":"NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS","DOI":"10.1007/s00521-021-05800-6","ISSN":"0941-0643","issue":"7, SI","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,3]]},"page":"5033-5054","title":"A conceptual framework for blockchain smart contract adoption to manage real estate deals in smart cities","type":"article-journal","volume":"35"},

  {"id":"vaghaniSecurityQoSIssues2022","abstract":"The blockchain-enabled smart logistics market is expected to grow worth USD 1620 billion and at a compound annual growth rate of 62.4%. Smart logistics ensures intelligence infrastructure, logistics automation, real-time analysis of supply chain data synchronization of the logistics process, cost transparency, unbroken shipment tracking all the way down to the transportation route, etc. In the smart logistics domain, significant advancement and growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors are evident. However, the connectivity of IoT systems, including Tactile Internet, without proper safeguards creates vulnerabilities that can still be deliberately or inadvertently cause disruption. In view of this, we primarily notice two key issues. Firstly, the logistics domain can be compromised by a variety of natural or man-made activities, which eventually affect the overall network security. Secondly, there are thousands of entities in the supply chain network that use extensive machinelearning algorithms in many scenarios, and they require high-power computational resources. From these two challenges, we note that the first concern can be addressed by adding blockchain to IoT logistic networks. The second issue can be addressed using 6G. This will support 1-mu s latency communications, support seamless computing at the edges of networks, and autonomously predict the best optimal location for edge computing. Motivated by this, we have highlighted motivational examples to show the necessity to integrate 6G and blockchain in smart logistic networks. Then, we have proposed a 6G and blockchain-enabled smart logistic highlevel framework. We have presented the key intrinsic issues of this framework mainly from the security and resource management context. In this paper, recent state-of-the-art advances in blockchain enabled nextgeneration smart logistic networks are analyzed. We have also examined why 6G and not 5G would be compatible with the smart network. We have introduced five different use cases of blockchain technology in smart logistics. Later, this paper discusses some important concerns that blockchain in smart logistics might face. We have also provided potential solutions to tackle these concerns.","author":[{"family":"Vaghani","given":"Anjali"},{"family":"Sood","given":"Keshav"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Shui"}],"citation-key":"vaghaniSecurityQoSIssues2022","container-title":"BLOCKCHAIN-RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS","DOI":"10.1016/j.bcra.2022.100082","ISSN":"2096-7209","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,9]]},"title":"Security and QoS issues in blockchain enabled next-generation smart logistic networks: A tutorial","type":"article-journal","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"venkatramanBigDataSecurity2019","abstract":"Big data, a recently popular term that refers to a massive collection of very large and complex data sets, is facing serious security and privacy challenges. Due to the typical characteristics of big data, namely velocity, volume and variety associated with large-scale cloud infrastructures and the Internet of Things (IoT), traditional security and privacy mechanisms are inadequate and unable to cope with the rapid data explosion in such a complex distributed computing environment. With big data analytics being widely used by businesses and government for decision making, security risk mitigation plays an important role in big data infrastructures worldwide. Traditional security mechanisms have failed to cope with the scalability, interoperability and adaptability of contemporary technologies that are required for big data. This paper takes an exploratory initial step using first principles to address this gap in literature. Firstly, we establish the current trends in big data comprehensively by identifying eleven Vs as important dimensions of big data, which form the contributing factors having an impact on the impending security problem. Next, we map the eleven Vs to the three phases of big data life cycle in order to unearth the major security and privacy challenges of big data. Finally, the paper provides four practical strategies adapted from contemporary technologies such as data provenance, encryption and access control, data mining and blockchain, identifying their associated real implementation examples. This work would pave way for future research investigations in this important big data security arena.","author":[{"family":"Venkatraman","given":"Sitalakshmi"},{"family":"Venkatraman","given":"Ramanathan"}],"citation-key":"venkatramanBigDataSecurity2019","container-title":"AIMS MATHEMATICS","DOI":"10.3934/math.2019.3.860","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"page":"860-879","title":"Big data security challenges and strategies","type":"article-journal","volume":"4"},

The limitations due to IoT restricted power and computing devices also raise concerns about security vulnerabilities. Machine learning-based techniques have recently gained credibility in a successful application for the detection of network anomalies, including IoT networks. However, machine learning techniques cannot work without representative data. Given the scarcity of IoT datasets, the DAD emerged as an instrument for knowing the behavior of dedicated IoT-MQTT networks. This paper aims to validate the DAD dataset by applying Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Support Vector Machine to detect traffic anomalies in IoT. To obtain the best results, techniques for handling unbalanced data, feature selection, and grid search for hyperparameter optimization have been used. The experimental results show that the proposed dataset can achieve a high detection rate in all the experiments, providing the best mean accuracy of 0.99 for the tree-based models, with a low false-positive rate, ensuring effective anomaly detection.","author":[{"family":"Vigoya","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Fernandez","given":"Diego"},{"family":"Carneiro","given":"Victor"},{"family":"Novoa","given":"Francisco J."}],"citation-key":"vigoyaIoTDatasetValidation2021","container-title":"ELECTRONICS","DOI":"10.3390/electronics10222857","issue":"22","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,11]]},"title":"IoT Dataset Validation Using Machine Learning Techniques for Traffic Anomaly Detection","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"viriyasitavatWhenBlockchainMeets2019","abstract":"Researches in Blockchain Technology (BCT) and Internet of Things (IoT) are experiencing exponential growth in recent years. They are being witnessed as mainstream technologies that have the potential of revolutionizing our society. However, these two contain technologically unrelated in philosophies. This article has a special interest in exploring how BCT and IoT can benefit in innovating business models. The purpose of this work is to understand the state of the art how BCT can be utilized within IoT context to create secure decentralized architecture. IoT is not secure by design, making its applications vulnerable especially to security and privacy threats. This hinders the proliferation of IoT applications in a large scale. With BCT capabilities, BCT can be used as integral part that can solve many shortcomings of IoT applications. Thus, existing businesses can be improved, and new business models can be brought into reality. Eliminating the need of third parties to guarantee trust of business transactions is a significant value towards business innovation in many areas, such as digital supply chain, vehicular systems, surveillance systems, and the creation of new business models, e.g. sharing economy, local energy trading, smart city, to name but a few. In an effort to understand the state of the art, this article (1) highlights intrinsic characteristics of IoT, (2) describes BCT modes and their characteristics to be considered for IoT integration, (3) presents a comprehensive survey on business opportunities based on the usage of BCT and IoT from a wide variety of literatures, (4) analyse strengths and weaknesses, and (5) discusses research possibilities that can be a solution to the problems. This paper will serve as a good starting and reference point to new researchers or those who are interested in adopting these technologies in businesses.","author":[{"family":"Viriyasitavat","given":"Wattana"},{"family":"Anuphaptrirong","given":"Tharwon"},{"family":"Hoonsopon","given":"Danupol"}],"citation-key":"viriyasitavatWhenBlockchainMeets2019","container-title":"JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL INFORMATION INTEGRATION","DOI":"10.1016/j.jii.2019.05.002","ISSN":"2467-964X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9]]},"page":"21-28","title":"When blockchain meets Internet of Things: Characteristics, challenges, and business opportunities","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"wangBlockchainBasedMultiCACrossDomain2022","abstract":"The continuous development of network technology has driven the emergence of smart devices, and the demand for smart devices interconnection has increased sharply, which requires the identity of devices to be authenticated to carry out secure communication. The traditional certificate-based identity authentication scheme can no longer meet the authentication requirements of massive devices. As an authority that issues and manages certificates, Certificate Authority (CA) creates data islands of intra-domain certificates, increasing the complexity of cross-domain authentication. In order to improve the efficiency of cross-domain authentication, this paper introduces blockchain technology, which can establish trust in an untrusted environment. We propose a multi-CA-based authentication architecture to establish distributed trust and share cross-domain certificate information among multiple domains. On this basis, we design a simplified identity authentication scheme to quickly complete cross-domain identity authentication and reduce authentication overhead. To further improve the efficiency of cross-domain authentication, a cross-domain certificate revocation mechanism is designed. The scheme has passed the formal security analysis, and the simulation results show that the cross-domain authentication scheme is efficient.","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Miaomiao"},{"family":"Rui","given":"Lanlan"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Yang"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Zhipeng"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xingyu"}],"citation-key":"wangBlockchainBasedMultiCACrossDomain2022","container-title":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORK AND SERVICE MANAGEMENT","DOI":"10.1109/TNSM.2022.3180357","ISSN":"1932-4537","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,9]]},"page":"2664-2676","title":"A Blockchain-Based Multi-CA Cross-Domain Authentication Scheme in Decentralized Autonomous Network","type":"article-journal","volume":"19"},
  {"id":"wangBlockchainenabledWirelessCommunications2021","abstract":"With the deployment of fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks worldwide, research on sixth-generation (6G) wireless communications has commenced. It is expected that 6G networks can accommodate numerous heterogeneous devices and infrastructures with enhanced efficiency and security over diverse, e.g. spectrum, computing and storage, resources. However, this goal is impeded by a number of trust-related issues that are often neglected in network designs. Blockchain, as an innovative and revolutionary technology that has arisen in the recent decade, provides a promising solution. Building on its nature of decentralization, transparency, anonymity, immutability, traceability and resiliency, blockchain can establish cooperative trust among separate network entities and facilitate, e.g. efficient resource sharing, trusted data interaction, secure access control, privacy protection, and tracing, certification and supervision functionalities for wireless networks, thus presenting a new paradigm towards 6G. This paper is dedicated to blockchain-enabled wireless communication technologies. We first provide a brief introduction to the fundamentals of blockchain, and then we conduct a comprehensive investigation of the most recent efforts in incorporating blockchain into wireless communications from several aspects. Importantly, we further propose a unified framework of the blockchain radio access network (B-RAN) as a trustworthy and secure paradigm for 6G networking by utilizing blockchain technologies with enhanced efficiency and security. The critical elements of B-RAN, such as consensus mechanisms, smart contract, trustworthy access, mathematical modeling, cross-network sharing, data tracking and auditing and intelligent networking, are elaborated. We also provide the prototype design of B-RAN along with the latest experimental results.","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Jiaheng"},{"family":"Ling","given":"Xintong"},{"family":"Le","given":"Yuwei"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Yongming"},{"family":"You","given":"Xiaohu"}],"citation-key":"wangBlockchainenabledWirelessCommunications2021","container-title":"NATIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW","DOI":"10.1093/nsr/nwab069","ISSN":"2095-5138","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,9]]},"title":"Blockchain-enabled wireless communications: a new paradigm towards 6G","type":"article-journal","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"wangCapacityBlockchainBased2019","abstract":"An integration of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and blockchain becomes increasingly important to secure IoT data in an anti-tampering manner. Challenges arise from the immense scale of IoT and the resultant impact of network partitioning on blockchain. We design a new testbed to evaluate the impact, where resource-limited IoT devices, acting as light nodes, are an integral part of a blockchain. Our testbed is built on the Ethereum platform with non-trivial modifications on key modules. The partitioning of IoT is emulated by probabilistically dropping blocks travelling among the miners. We also propose a new discrete-time Markov chain model to validate our testbed and analyze the impact of block mining rates and network conditions on the capacity of public blockchains. The model is first formed to be non-ergodic with an infinite state space. By exploiting the eventual consistency property of blockchain, the model is collapsed to be ergodic and approximated with a finite state space and significantly improved tractability. Both the testbed and analysis reveal the blockchain capacity can be improved by accelerating the block mining rates which, however, increases stale blocks. Our analysis provides an asymptotic upper bound for the blockchain capacity. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

  {"id":"wangETCOrientedEfficientSecure2021","abstract":"An electronic toll collection (ETC) system is one of the most important parts of an intelligent transportation system (ITS), but existing ETC systems are not efficient and have vehicle fee evasion complications. Owing to the traceability and tamper resistance of a blockchain, the combination of a blockchain and ETC system is a feasible way to solve the above problems. However, traditional blockchain (e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum) has high power consumption and low efficiency. Hence, it cannot be used in ETC systems with high throughput and is not suitable for power-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In this study, therefore, we propose a blockchain architecture for the ETC system. To curb vehicle fee evasion behavior, thereby reducing the economic loss caused, we propose a vehicle behavior management mechanism based on credit value. Furthermore, to reduce the burden of storage and build a chain of evidence for auditing purposes, we propose an evidence chain framework. To protect the data security in the transaction process, we designed a data protection method to encrypt the transaction data. Additionally, this system is based on an open-source alliance blockchain framework called Hyperledger Fabric, which is more in line with the current application scenarios of ETC systems. We implemented the system on a Raspberry Pi and carried out simulations. The comprehensive evaluation results and analysis show that the system effectively reduces the number of illegal acts, completes the evidence inspection, and improves the security of the data.","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Jishu"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Rui"},{"family":"Li","given":"Tong"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Fengsen"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Qiang"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Qiang"}],"citation-key":"wangETCOrientedEfficientSecure2021","container-title":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY","DOI":"10.1109/TVT.2021.3116237","ISSN":"0018-9545","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,11]]},"page":"11324-11337","title":"ETC-Oriented Efficient and Secure Blockchain: Credit-Based Mechanism and Evidence Framework for Vehicle Management","type":"article-journal","volume":"70"},

Although the first DDoS attack was reported in 1996, the complexity and sophistication of these attacks has been ever increasing. A 2 TBps attack was reported in mid-August 2020 directed towards critical infrastructure, such as finance, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. It is estimated that these attacks will double, reaching over 15 million, in the next 2 years. A number of mitigation schemes have been designed and developed since its inception but the increasing complexity demands advanced solutions based on emerging technologies. Blockchain has emerged as a promising and viable technology for DDoS mitigation. The inherent and fundamental characteristics of blockchain such as decentralization, internal and external trustless attitude, immutability, integrity, anonymity and verifiability have proven to be strong candidates, in tackling this deadly cyber threat. This survey discusses different approaches for DDoS mitigation using blockchain in varied domains to date. The paper aims at providing a comprehensive review, highlighting all necessary details, strengths, challenges and limitations of different approaches.

  {"id":"wazidBlockchainEnvisionedSecureAuthentication2021","abstract":"The Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) is the amalgamation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods and the Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure, which are deployed there to improve the overall performance of the system. AIoT can be deployed to achieve more efficient IoT operations; thereby can improve human-machine interactions and provide better data analysis. AI methods can be used to transform IoT data into useful information for the better decision-making processes, and it further increases the overall usability of the system. AIoT frameworks are very useful and applicable in a variety of applications, like security and surveillance system, smart home, intelligent transportation system, smart farming, secure and safe healthcare monitoring, industrial automation and control, eCommerce, logistics operations and control, and many more. However, AIoT frameworks may have issues related to data security and privacy as they are vulnerable to various types of information security-related attacks. These issues further cause the serious consequences, like the unauthorized data leakage and data update. Blockchain is a specific type of database. It is a digital ledger of transactions, which is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems. It stores data in the form of some blocks, which are then chained together. Blockchain is tamper proof and provides more security as compared to the traditional security mechanisms. Hence, blockchain can be integrated in various AIoT applications to provide more security. A generalized blockchain-envisioned secure authentication framework for AIoT has been proposed. The adversary model of blockchain-envisioned secure authentication framework for AIoT is also highlighted that covers most of the potential threats of a kind of communication environment. Various applications of the proposed framework are also discussed. Furthermore, different issues and challenges of the proposed framework are highlighted. In the end, we also provide some future research directions relevant to the proposed framework.","author":[{"family":"Wazid","given":"Mohammad"},{"family":"Das","given":"Ashok Kumar"},{"family":"Park","given":"Youngho"}],"citation-key":"wazidBlockchainEnvisionedSecureAuthentication2021","container-title":"WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING","DOI":"10.1155/2021/3866006","ISSN":"1530-8669","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,7]]},"title":"Blockchain-Envisioned Secure Authentication Approach in AIoT: Applications, Challenges, and Future Research","type":"article-journal","volume":"2021"},

  {"id":"weberAttackDetectionMedical2023","abstract":"The threat situation due to cyber attacks in hospitals is emerging and patient life is at risk. One significant source of potential vulnerabilities is medical cyber-physical systems (MCPS). Detecting intrusions in this environment faces challenges different from other domains, mainly due to the heterogeneity of devices, the diversity of connectivity types, and the variety of terminology. To summarize existing results, we conducted a structured literature review (SLR) following the guidelines of Kitchenham et al. for SLRs in software engineering. We developed six research questions regarding detection approach, detection location, included features, adversarial focus, utilized datasets, and intrusion prevention. We identified that most researchers focused on an anomaly-based detection approach at the network layer. The primary focus was on the detection of malicious insiders. While several researchers used publicly available datasets for training and testing their algorithms, the lack of suitable datasets resulted in the development of testbeds consisting of various medical devices. Based on the results, we formulated five future research topics. First, the special conditions of hospital networks, the MCPS deployed within them, and the contrasts to other IT and OT environments should be examined. Thereupon, MCPS-specific datasets should be created that allow researchers to address the health domain's unique requirements and possibilities. At the same time, endeavors aimed at standardization in this area should be supported and expanded. Moreover, the use of medical context for attack detection should be further explored. Last but not least, efforts for MCPS-tailored intrusion prevention should be intensified. This way, the emerging threat landscape can be addressed, IT security in hospitals can be improved, and patient health can be protected.","author":[{"family":"Weber","given":"Simon B.

  {"id":"wenhuaBlockchainTechnologySecurity2023","abstract":"Blockchain technology provides a data structure with inherent security properties that include cryptography, decentralization, and consensus, which ensure trust in transactions. It covers widely applicable usages, such as in intelligent manufacturing, finance, the Internet of things (IoT), medicine and health, and many different areas, especially in medical health data security and privacy protection areas. Its natural attributes, such as contracts and consensus mechanisms, have leading-edge advantages in protecting data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The security issues are gradually revealed with in-depth research and vigorous development. Unlike traditional paper storage methods, modern medical records are stored electronically. Blockchain technology provided a decentralized solution to the trust-less issues between distrusting parties without third-party guarantees, but the “trust-less” security through technology was easily misunderstood and hindered the security differences between public and private blockchains appropriately. The mentioned advantages and disadvantages motivated us to provide an advancement and comprehensive study regarding the applicability of blockchain technology. This paper focuses on the healthcare security issues in blockchain and sorts out the security risks in six layers of blockchain technology by comparing and analyzing existing security measures. It also explores and defines the different security attacks and challenges when applying blockchain technology, which promotes theoretical research and robust security protocol development in the current and future distributed work environment.","author":[{"family":"Wenhua","given":"Zhang"},{"family":"Qamar","given":"Faizan"},{"family":"Abdali","given":"Taj-Aldeen Naser"},{"family":"Hassan","given":"Rosilah"},{"family":"Jafri","given":"Syed Talib Abbas"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Quang Ngoc"}],"citation-key":"wenhuaBlockchainTechnologySecurity2023","container-title":"ELECTRONICS","DOI":"10.3390/electronics12030546","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,2]]},"title":"Blockchain Technology: Security Issues, Healthcare Applications, Challenges and Future Trends","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"wuP2PEnergyTrading2022","abstract":"A deeper decarbonization perspective is undergoing with the increasing engagement of new distributed players and the deployment of innovative behind-the-meter flexibility services. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) trading has emerged as an innovative mechanism to foster the direct energy sharing among multi-level market players with pre-determined responsibility and privacy. However, compared with other P2P assets trading, P2P energy trading is facing huge challenges in achieving a large-scale commercialization due to the cooperation obstacles between non-professional distributed players and regulated players as Distributed System Operator (DSO), Transmission System Operator (TSO) and utilities. It is related to not only business and marketing, but also energy system operation to keep secure and reliable with injection of new roles, new utilization patterns, and new markets. This paper investigates the socio-technical interaction and mechanism for the sustainable P2P energy trading from the social dimension on the cooperation of multi-level market players, the technical dimension on the cutting-edge exchange of flexibility, and the economical dimension on the inter-operative decentralized/regulated marketplaces. Three questions are targeted on: (1) How Information and Communication Technology (ICT) enables co-creation of decentralized heterogeneous user-centered digital frameworks for the large-scale P2P trading interaction, (2) What specific energy services drive the cross-border interactions for exchange of multi-scale P2P flexibility, (3) How operational framework in P2P energy trading achieves the inter-operative marketplaces with the formation of trusted P2P energy society and the injection of multi-scale flexibility services. Finally, regulation challenges on P2P energy trading implementation are discussed for the guide of future work. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

The concept of “smart city” brings opportunities to solve these urban problems. The objectives of smart cities are to make the best use of public resources, provide high-quality services to the citizens, and improve the people's quality of life. Information and communication technology plays an important role in the implementation of smart cities. Blockchain as an emerging technology has many good features, such as trust-free, transparency, pseudonymity, democracy, automation, decentralization, and security. These features of blockchain are helpful to improve smart city services and promote the development of smart cities. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the literature involving blockchain technology applied to smart cities. First, the related works and background knowledge are introduced. Then, we review how blockchain technology is applied in the realm of smart cities, from the perspectives of smart citizen, smart healthcare, smart grid, smart transportation, supply chain management, and others.

  {"id":"xuArtificialIntelligenceSecuring2020","abstract":"With the explosive growth of data generated by the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the traditional cloud computing model by transferring all data to the cloud for processing has gradually failed to meet the real-time requirement of IoT services due to high network latency. Edge computing (EC) as a new computing paradigm shifts the data processing from the cloud to the edge nodes (ENs), greatly improving the Quality of Service (QoS) for those IoT applications with low-latency requirements. However, compared to other endpoint devices such as smartphones or computers, distributed ENs are more vulnerable to attacks for restricted computing resources and storage. In the context that security and privacy preservation have become urgent issues for EC, great progress in artificial intelligence (AI) opens many possible windows to address the security challenges. The powerful learning ability of AI enables the system to identify malicious attacks more accurately and efficiently. Meanwhile, to a certain extent, transferring model parameters instead of raw data avoids privacy leakage. In this paper, a comprehensive survey of the contribution of AI to the IoT security in EC is presented. First, the research status and some basic definitions are introduced. Next, the IoT service framework with EC is discussed. The survey of privacy preservation and blockchain for edge-enabled IoT services with AI is then presented. In the end, the open issues and challenges on the application of AI in IoT services based on EC are discussed.","author":[{"family":"Xu","given":"Zhanyang"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Wentao"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Jingwang"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Chenyi"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Jiawei"},{"family":"Tan","given":"Haozhe"}],"citation-key":"xuArtificialIntelligenceSecuring2020","container-title":"SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS","DOI":"10.1155/2020/8872586","ISSN":"1939-0114","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,14]]},"title":"Artificial Intelligence for Securing IoT Services in Edge Computing: A Survey","type":"article-journal","volume":"2020"},

  {"id":"xuMDFLSecureMicrochained2022","abstract":"Federated Learning (FL) has been recognized as a privacy-preserving machine learning (ML) technology that enables collaborative training and learning of a global ML model based on the aggregation of distributed local model updates. However, security and privacy guarantees could be compromised due to malicious participants and the centralized aggregation manner. Possessing attractive features like decentralization, immutability and auditability, Blockchain is promising to enable a tamper-proof and trust-free framework to enhance performance and security in IoT based FL systems. However, directly integrating blockchains into the large scale IoT-based FL scenarios still faces many limitations, such as high computation and storage demands, low transactions throughput, poor scalability and challenges in privacy preservation. This paper proposes mu DFL, a novel hierarchical IoT network fabric for decentralized federated learning (DFL) atop of a lightweight blockchain called microchain. Following the hierarchical infrastructure of FL, participants in mu DFL are fragmented into multiple small scale microchains. Each microchain network relies on a hybrid Proof of Credit (PoC) block generation and Voting-based Chain Finality (VCF) consensus protocol to ensure efficiency and privacy-preservation at the network of edge. Meanwhile, microchains are federated vie a high-level inter-chain network, which adopts an efficient Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus protocol to achieve scalability and security. A proof-of-concept prototype is implemented, and the experimental results verify the feasibility of the proposed mu DFL solution in cross-devices FL settings with efficiency, security and privacy guarantees.","author":[{"family":"Xu","given":"Ronghua"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Yu"}],"citation-key":"xuMDFLSecureMicrochained2022","container-title":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORK AND SERVICE MANAGEMENT","DOI":"10.1109/TNSM.2022.3179892","ISSN":"1932-4537","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,9]]},"page":"2677-2688","title":"μDFL: A Secure Microchained Decentralized Federated Learning Fabric Atop IoT Networks","type":"article-journal","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"xuSuitabilityAnalysisConsensus2023","abstract":"Blockchain technology has gained increasing attention in the construction sector. The process of developing a blockchain-based application that fits user requirements largely depends on the selection of a suitable consensus protocol, which acts as the centerpiece of blockchain architecture. In distributed networks, consensus protocols not only help maintain data consistency among all stakeholders, but also allow users to work together and stay secure. However, limited efforts have been delivered to analyze and compare existing consensus protocols under various construction scenarios, leading to uncertainties when applying blockchain technology in the construction domain. Therefore, this paper performs a critical review extracting literatures from (1) blockchain-based applications in the construction industry, and (2) existing blockchain consensus protocols. Additionally, a mixed method that integrates qualitative and quantitative analysis is proposed to evaluate the suitability of mainstream consensus protocols for various construction-related applications. Based on the selection criteria and efficiency requirements of consensus protocols generated, a recommendation strategy is also presented for consensus protocol selection under different construction scenarios. This study contributes to the following: (1) it helps construction stakeholders to understand the consensus process in a specific construction application case, and (2) it provides lucid reference guidance in developing a robust blockchain-based system underlying an appropriate consensus protocol.","author":[{"family":"Xu","given":"Yuqing"},{"family":"Tao","given":"Xingyu"},{"family":"Das","given":"Moumita"},{"family":"Kwok","given":"Helen H.

  {"id":"yadavExploringRelationshipDigitalization2023","abstract":"PurposeThis study aims to explore the mediating role of digital technologies-based supply chain integrating (SCI) strategies on the agri-supply chain performance (SCP) and firm performance (FP). This research has introduced recently emerged digital technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT). Further, based on theoretical support and an extensive literature review, this research has proposed some hypotheses, which have been quantitatively validated for their significance.Design/methodology/approachA conceptual model was formulated based on an extensive literature review. Data for this research were gathered from a survey completed by 119 respondents from different departments of agri-firms. Further, partial least square (PLS)-based structured equation modelling (SEM) was used to test the proposed hypothetical model.FindingsThe results confirm that IoT-based digital technologies and supply chain processes (organization integration [OI], information sharing and customer integration [CI]) have a significant positive correlation. Furthermore, supply chain practices are positively associated with SCP. Finally, it has been found that FP is positively impacted by SCP.Research limitations/implicationsThis research is used to analyse the mediating impacts of digital supply chain processes as a linking strategy for SCP and FP. For practical purposes, this research provides investment decisions for implementing digital technologies in SC strategies. The findings have proposed implications for managers and practitioners in agri-firms based on existing theories: contingency theory (CT) and relational view theory. Also, this study suggests the deployment of smarter electronically based tags and readers, which improve the data analytics capabilities based on auto-captured data. Thus, the availability of quality information improves the data-driven decisional capabilities of managers at company level.Originality/valueThis is a unique and original study exploring the relationship between digitalization, resilient agri-food supply chain (AFSC) management practices and firm performance.

  {"id":"yadavExploringSynergyBlockchain2023","abstract":"Automating industrial tasks have become critical for organizations due to the inefficiencies and risks associated with conventional procedures. The proliferation of connected devices and machines brings forth a range of security concerns, including data tampering and unauthorized access. Establishing confidential and trustworthy communication between these devices becomes particularly difficult as they rely on the open channel of the Internet. Numerous established security measures, such as antivirus software, access control systems, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and intrusion prevention systems (IPS), have been identified in the literature as facing issues like centralized vulnerabilities, latency challenges, reliability issues, and single points of failure. As technology advances rapidly, the convergence of emerging technologies holds immense potential to revolutionize industrial automation. Among these promising technologies, blockchain and 6G stand out for their immense potential. With its decentralized and tamper-proof nature, blockchain has disrupted various sectors, while 6G offers unprecedented connectivity and lightning-fast data transfer speeds. Motivated by these developments, this paper explores the potential impact of integrating blockchain technology with 6G in industrial automation, paving the way for the future of smart factories and intelligent supply chains. Our proposed work aims to provide a holistic understanding of this emerging amalgamation's key benefits, challenges, offered solutions, and prospects.","author":[{"family":"Yadav","given":"Mano"},{"family":"Agarwal","given":"Udit"},{"family":"Rishiwal","given":"Vinay"},{"family":"Tanwar","given":"Sudeep"},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Suman"},{"family":"Alqahtani","given":"Fayez"},{"family":"Tolba","given":"Amr"}],"citation-key":"yadavExploringSynergyBlockchain2023","container-title":"IEEE ACCESS","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3338861","ISSN":"2169-3536","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023]]},"page":"137163-137187","title":"Exploring Synergy of Blockchain and 6G Network for Industrial Automation","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},

Nevertheless, as a result of the inherently open nature of radio transmission paths in the IoD, data collected, generated or handled by drones is plagued by many security concerns. Since security and privacy are among the foremost challenges for the IoD, in this paper we conduct a comprehensive review on security issues and solutions for IoD security, discussing IoD-related security requirements and identifying the latest advancement in IoD security research. This review analyzes a host of important security technologies with emphases on authentication techniques and blockchain-powered schemes. Based on a detailed analysis, we present the challenges faced by current methodologies and recommend future IoD security research directions. This review shows that appropriate security measures are needed to address IoD security issues, and that newly designed security solutions should particularly consider the balance between the level of security and cost efficiency.","author":[{"family":"Yang","given":"Wencheng"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Song"},{"family":"Yin","given":"Xuefei"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xu"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Jiankun"}],"citation-key":"yangReviewSecurityIssues2022","container-title":"IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMPUTER SOCIETY","DOI":"10.1109/OJCS.2022.3183003","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,14]]},"page":"96-110","title":"A Review on Security Issues and Solutions of the Internet of Drones","type":"article-journal","volume":"3"},

The growing number of networked IoT devices generates a large amount of data. However, processing and memorizing this massive volume of data at local nodes have been deemed critical challenges, especially when using artificial intelligence (AI) systems to extract and exploit valuable information. In this context, mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a way to bring cloud computing (CC) processes within reach of users, to address computation-intensive offloading and latency issues. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the most relevant research works related to UAV technology applications in terms of enabled or assisted MEC architectures.

  {"id":"yuIntegratingBlockchainBuilding2023","abstract":"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyse the current state of research on the integration of blockchain and building information modelling (BIM) in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations (AECO) industry as a means of identifying gaps between the existing paradigm and practical applications for determining future research directions and improving the industry. The study aims to provide clear guidance on areas that need attention for further research and funding and to draw academic attention to factors beyond the technical dimension.Design/methodology/approach A mixed-method systematic review is used, considering multiple literature types and using a sociotechnical perspective-based framework that covers three dimensions (technic, process and context) and three research elements (why, what and how). Data are retrieved and analysed from the Web of Science and Scopus databases for the 2017-2023 period.Findings While blockchain has the potential to address security, traceability and transparency and complement the system by integrating supporting applications, significant gaps still exist between these potentials and widespread industry adoption. Current limitations and further research needs are identified, including designing fully integrated prototypes, empirical research to identify operational processes, testing and analysing operational-level models or applications and developing and applying a technology acceptance model for the integration paradigm. Previous research lacks contextual settings, real-world tests or empirical investigations and is primarily conceptual.Originality/value This paper provides a comprehensive, critical systematic review of the integration of blockchain with BIM in the construction industry, using a sociotechnical perspective-based framework which can be applied in future reviews. The study provides insight into the current state and future opportunities for policymakers and practitioners in the AECO industry to prepare for the transition in this disruptive paradigm. It also provides a phased plan along with a clear direction for the transition to more advanced applications.","author":[{"family":"Yu","given":"Jiyang"},{"family":"Zhong","given":"Hua"},{"family":"Bolpagni","given":"Marzia"}],"citation-key":"yuIntegratingBlockchainBuilding2023","container-title":"CONSTRUCTION INNOVATION-ENGLAND","DOI":"10.1108/CI-04-2023-0082","ISSN":"1471-4175","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,9,14]]},"title":"Integrating blockchain with building information modelling (BIM): a systematic review based on a sociotechnical system perspective","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"zabihiReinforcementLearningMethods2024","abstract":"Today, cloud computation offloading may not be an appropriate solution for delay-sensitive applications due to the long distance between end-devices and remote datacenters. In addition, offloading to a remote cloud can consume bandwidth and dramatically increase costs. However, end-devices such as sensors, cameras, and smartphones have limited computing and storage capacity. Processing tasks on such battery-powered and energy-constrained devices becomes even more complex. To address these challenges, a new paradigm called Edge Computing (EC) emerged nearly a decade ago to bring computing resources closer to end-devices. Here, edge servers located between the end-device and the remote cloud perform user tasks. Recently, several new computing paradigms such as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and Fog Computing (FC) have emerged to complement Cloud Computing (CC) and EC. Although these paradigms are heterogeneous, they can further reduce energy consumption and task response time, especially for delay-sensitive applications. Computation offloading is a multi-objective, NP-hard optimization problem. A significant part of previous research in this field is devoted to Machine Learning (ML) methods. One of the essential types of ML is Reinforcement Learning (RL), in which an agent learns how to make the best decision using the experiences gained from the environment. This article provides a systematic review of the widely used RL approaches in computation offloading. It covers research in complementary paradigms such as mobile cloud computing, edge computing, fog computing, and the Internet of Things. We explain the reasons for using various RL methods in computation offloading from a technical point of view. This analysis includes both binary offloading and partial offloading techniques. For each method, the essential elements of RL and the characteristics of the environment are discussed regarding the most important criteria. Research challenges and Future trends are also mentioned.","author":[{"family":"Zabihi","given":"Zeinab"},{"family":"Moghadam","given":"Amir Masoud Eftekhari"},{"family":"Rezvani","given":"Mohammad Hossein"}],"citation-key":"zabihiReinforcementLearningMethods2024","container-title":"ACM COMPUTING SURVEYS","DOI":"10.1145/3603703","ISSN":"0360-0300","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2024,1]]},"title":"Reinforcement Learning Methods for Computation Offloading: A Systematic Review","type":"article-journal","volume":"56"},

  {"id":"zafarInterplayBigSpectrum2019","abstract":"In the current epoch of technology trends, Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging technology that illustrates the significant transition for enterprises to extend their businesses. Such technologies not only spark the growth in business, but also add values to our daily lives in many aspects such as livelihood, health, work, and entertainment. Nowadays, with the emergence of wireless infrastructure and the advancements in cellular technologies, Mobile IoT (MIoT) has gained considerable amount of attention. Intelligent decisions are made based on the information retrieved from raw data through sensors, machines, and other devices. These decisions are widely utilized in many fields of life such as smart health-care, smart transportation, and smart energy etc. Usually such smart systems are realized through MIoT infrastructure. The devices participating in MIoT are heterogeneous and produce huge amount of data, and contribute to cross-platform solutions covering plethora of applications. In the wake of such volume and variety, the data produced because of spectrum analysis for the entire IoT network is also huge and thus referred to as Big Spectrum Data (BSD). To this end, BSD is a way forward to get deep insights to the big data generated by MIoT. In this paper, we conduct a systematic review of the MIoT network focusing on the characteristics of mobility in MIoT from BSD perspective. More precisely, we focus on the relationship between MIoT and BSD, and discuss in detail, the BSD analytics to harness its benefits in MIoT. Furthermore, we investigate and outline the current solutions of BSD in MIoT. Additionally, through this work, we identify the existing challenges faced in dealing with BSD in MIoT and future research directions.

  {"id":"zamanSecureIntelligentInternet2022","abstract":"With the growth of computing and communication technologies, the information processing paradigm of the healthcare environment is evolving. The patient information is stored electronically, making it convenient to store and retrieve patient information remotely when needed. However, evolving the healthcare systems into smart healthcare environments comes with challenges and additional pressures. Internet of Things (IoT) connects things, such as computing devices, through wired or wireless mediums to form a network. There are numerous security vulnerabilities and risks in the existing IoT-based systems due to the lack of intrinsic security technologies. For example, patient medical data, data privacy, data sharing, and convenience are considered imperative for collecting and storing electronic health records (EHR). However, the traditional IoT-based EHR systems cannot deal with these paradigms because of inconsistent security policies and data access structures. Blockchain (BC) technology is a decentralized and distributed ledger that comes in handy in storing patient data and encountering data integrity and confidentiality challenges. Therefore, it is a viable solution for addressing existing IoT data security and privacy challenges. BC paves a tremendous path to revolutionize traditional IoT systems by enhancing data security, privacy, and transparency. The scientific community has shown a variety of healthcare applications based on artificial intelligence (AI) that improve health diagnosis and monitoring practices. Moreover, technology companies and startups are revolutionizing healthcare with AI and related technologies. This study illustrates the implication of integrated technologies based on BC, IoT, and AI to meet growing healthcare challenges. This research study examines the integration of BC technology with IoT and analyzes the advancements of these innovative paradigms in the healthcare sector. In addition, our research study presents a detailed survey on enabling technologies for the futuristic, intelligent, and secure internet of health things (IoHT). Furthermore, this study comprehensively studies the peculiarities of the IoHT environment and the security, performance, and progression of the enabling technologies. First, the research gaps are identified by mapping security and performance benefits inferred by the BC technologies. Secondly, practical issues related to the integration process of BC and IoT devices are discussed. Third, the healthcare applications integrating IoT, BC, and ML in healthcare environments are discussed.

  {"id":"zhangBlockchainApplicationsConstruction2023","abstract":"Recently, there has been increasing interest in the research of blockchain applications in construction contract management (CCM). CCM is currently flawed, mainly lacking in information sharing, on-time payment processes, and an easily traceable supply chain. Applying blockchain-based applications can achieve autotransaction processes, create a secure information delivery environment, and promote collaboration among organizations. This research aims to discuss the application of blockchain technology in construction contract management, evaluate the benefits and drawbacks associated with blockchain application, and propose recommended strategies to facilitate the smooth implementation of blockchain technology for improved construction contract management practices. A systematic literature review is used as the main research, and content analysis is employed for analyzing the literature. The literature analysis shows that blockchain application in CCM mainly falls under three areas: information management; payment management; and supply chain management. Under each area, the current drawbacks in CCM, as well as the opportunities and challenges associated with blockchain applications, are presented. This research is one of the first attempts to examine the application of a blockchain in CCM systematically; it also provides construction contract managers or administrators with practical guidelines on leveraging blockchain technology to improve CCM practices.

  {"id":"zhangBlockchainAssistedPrivacyPreservingTraffic2023","abstract":"Traffic route management is essential for reducing traffic jams and enhancing driving safety because of the growing number of vehicles and frequent occurrence of traffic accidents. However, in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs), real-time messages are transmitted via wireless channels, which can result in security and privacy concerns. Existing proposals for traffic route management exist security vulnerabilities, as well as high calculation and communication costs. Encouraged by this fact, we design a lightweight traffic route management scheme for fog-based VANETs. In this scheme, vehicles utilize homomorphic encryption to encrypt their driving routes and then send the encrypted information to a fog node. The traffic management center (TMC) decrypts the received ciphertexts that are aggregated by the fog node and performs traffic management according to the decrypted data, without knowing individual route of each vehicle. Furthermore, blockchain is used in the scheme to conduct public keys management of vehicles. Our detailed security proof and analysis indicate that our proposal can meet the security objectives of VANETs. Further, to demonstrate the feasibility of the scheme, we also implement it in the Ethereum test network (i.e., Rinkeby). Significantly, the performance analysis demonstrates that our proposal achieves a better performance than other relevant representative schemes.","author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Fang","given":"Huixia"},{"family":"Zhong","given":"Hong"},{"family":"Cui","given":"Jie"},{"family":"He","given":"Debiao"}],"citation-key":"zhangBlockchainAssistedPrivacyPreservingTraffic2023","container-title":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORK AND SERVICE MANAGEMENT","DOI":"10.1109/TNSM.2023.3238307","ISSN":"1932-4537","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,9]]},"page":"2854-2868","title":"Blockchain-Assisted Privacy-Preserving Traffic Route Management Scheme for Fog-Based Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks","type":"article-journal","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"zhangFederatedLearningIntelligent2023","abstract":"Intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) have been fueled by the rapid development of communication technologies, sensor technologies, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Nonetheless, due to the dynamic characteristics of the vehicle networks, it is rather challenging to make timely and accurate decisions of vehicle behaviors. Moreover, in the presence of mobile wireless communications, the privacy and security of vehicle information are at constant risk. In this context, a new paradigm is urgently needed for various applications in dynamic vehicle environments. As a distributed machine learning technology, federated learning (FL) has received extensive attention due to its outstanding privacy protection properties and easy scalability. We conduct a comprehensive survey of the latest developments in FL for ITS. Specifically, we initially research the prevalent challenges in ITS and elucidate the motivations for applying FL from various perspectives. Subsequently, we review existing deployments of FL in ITS across various scenarios, and discuss specific potential issues in object recognition, traffic management, and service providing scenarios. Furthermore, we conduct a further analysis of the new challenges introduced by FL deployment and the inherent limitations that FL alone cannot fully address, including uneven data distribution, limited storage and computing power, and potential privacy and security concerns. We then examine the existing collaborative technologies that can help mitigate these challenges. Lastly, we discuss the open challenges that remain to be addressed in applying FL in ITS and propose several future research directions.","author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Shiying"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Long"},{"family":"Ding","given":"Ming"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Dinh C."},{"family":"Tan","given":"Wuzheng"},{"family":"Weng","given":"Jian"},{"family":"Han","given":"Zhu"}],"citation-key":"zhangFederatedLearningIntelligent2023","container-title":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IN℡LIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS","DOI":"10.1109/TITS.2023.3324962","ISSN":"1524-9050","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,21]]},"title":"Federated Learning in Intelligent Transportation Systems: Recent Applications and Open Problems","type":"article-journal"},

Ordering takeaways through takeout apps on smartphones is one of them. However, most existing takeaway platforms charge high commissions in the middle. There are many fake reviews in restaurants, the authenticity of restaurant ratings is low, and the recommended dishes have low customer satisfaction. This paper aims to solve this problem by introducing a peer-to-peer architecture based on blockchain smart contracts. The proposed architecture leverages the automation of smart contracts to provide autonomous, commission-free food ordering and delivery services. In addition, the smart contract reward mechanism is used to collect order information and rating information, and a deep learning recommendation model is introduced to analyze the data to recommend restaurants and menus to the client accurately. To demonstrate the usability and efficiency of the proposed method, we conducted a case study using public chain-based technologies. At the same time, comprehensive evaluation experiments are carried out, and the results show the importance of the proposed food delivery system.","author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Linchao"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Dohyeun"}],"citation-key":"zhangPeertoPeerSmartFood2022","container-title":"ELECTRONICS","DOI":"10.3390/electronics11121806","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,6]]},"title":"A Peer-to-Peer Smart Food Delivery Platform Based on Smart Contract","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},

However, the existing GIS has low transparency and is lack of flexibility between different departments. Aiming at such problems, this paper takes blockchain as a solusion, and systematically summarizes the development of digital GIS, the advantages and challenges of blockchain and its theoretical research and practical applications. Specifically, it reviews e-government interactive structure, big data and other solutions, analyses their imperfections, and puts forward blockchain-based solutions. The blockchain improves government service efficiency and data security, meanwhile it faces challenges in throughput and supervision. In order to meet these challenges, researchers propose solutions based on three data exchange scenarios: government-to-government, government-to-enterprise and government-toindividual. In addition to researches, blockchain-based GIS is put into use. The electronic licensing project of Nanjing (China) government is taken as an example to illustrate that blockchain has the ability to openly and securely verify, track, and exchange data, so as to improve management ability and public service level of government agencies.","author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Lu"},{"family":"Mao","given":"Jiarong"},{"family":"An","given":"Yuting"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Tianshuo"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Jixin"},{"family":"Feng","given":"Chen"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Xiaoyi"}],"citation-key":"zhangSystematicReviewBlockchain2023","container-title":"CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA","DOI":"10.32604/cmc.2023.032452","ISSN":"1546-2218","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023]]},"page":"1161-1181","title":"A Systematic Review of Blockchain Technology for Government Information Sharing","type":"article-journal","volume":"74"},

  {"id":"zhonghuaBlockchainBasedFrameworkHandle2023","abstract":"At present, the number of devices connected to IoT (the Internet of Things) systems is growing exponentially, and the operation of these devices generates huge amounts of data. Easily accessible data, such as a home address, age, and medical history, can cause users' privacy to be compromised. Managing and using such large amounts of data safely and effectively is a major challenge. The most important factor affecting the security of IoT operation is the security of IoT devices, which has not been properly addressed so far. Blockchain is a database composed of multiple nodes, with no central management equipment and institutions, security between nodes is verified through encryption technology, and there is no mutual trust. This article focused on the application cases of blockchain in the field of IoT system security and makes a literature review of the application of blockchain in the IoT systems. An important contribution of this paper is to provide a direction for subsequent researchers to conduct research on the security issues of the Internet of Things handled by blockchain. The application of blockchain technology in the IoT systems has become inevitable. Only by constantly strengthening the applicability and application research of blockchain technology in IoT can we meet the increasingly strong demand for IoT system technology and promote the further development of IoT systems.","author":[{"family":"Zhonghua","given":"Chen"},{"family":"Goyal","given":"S.

  {"id":"zhouBlockchainEnabledCrossBorderECommerce2022","abstract":"Driven by the internet-based advanced information technologies and logistics channel improvement, the cross-border e-commerce industry keeps an increasing trend in Chinese industrial market. Blockchain, as an empowered technology, contributes to the management innovations for industrial sectors. The blockchain technology, due to its transparency, visibility, and dis-intermediation characteristics, helps to improve operations management of cross-border e-commerce supply chain by innovative industrial applications. However, practical applications of the blockchain technique-enabled cross-border e-commerce sector are still in their infancy and still at the proof-of-concept stage. This paper presents a systematic review on blockchain-enabled cross-border e-commerce supply chain management by employing a bibliometric data-driven analysis. All relevant publications from the Web of Science database from 2013 to 2021 were collected as the research samples. Besides, the VosViewer is adopted to conduct the network and co-word study by visualizing collaborative relationships of sampled literatures. Results show that the blockchain technique has substantial applications in the field of cross-border e-commerce supply chain, whose contributions mainly focus on cross-border e-commerce platform, supply chain operations, and data governance and information management. Academic researchers and industrial managers can promote innovative management practices in cross-border e-commerce supply chain by adopting blockchain. Moreover, we hope this study serves as a future direction for both researchers and engineers on leveraging blockchain to improve the supply chain management performance of the cross-border e-commerce.","author":[{"family":"Zhou","given":"Fuli"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yijie"}],"citation-key":"zhouBlockchainEnabledCrossBorderECommerce2022","container-title":"SUSTAINABILITY","DOI":"10.3390/su142315918","issue":"23","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,12]]},"title":"Blockchain-Enabled Cross-Border E-Commerce Supply Chain Management: A Bibliometric Systematic Review","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},

We introduce the basic concepts of blockchain and smart contracts and explain how some of their features are enabled. We review several typical or novel applications of blockchain and smart contract technologies and their enabling concepts and underlying technologies. We classify the selected literature into five categories and discuss their motivations and technical designs. We recognize that the trend of decentralization creates a need to use blockchain and smart contracts to implement trust and distributed control mechanisms. We also speculate on future applications of blockchain and smart contracts. We believe that, in the future, blockchains with different consensus mechanisms will be studied and applied to achieve more efficient and practical decentralized systems. Also, blockchain-based smart contracts will be more widely applied to enhance autonomous distributed controls in decentralized systems.","author":[{"family":"Zhou","given":"Xiaochi"},{"family":"Kraft","given":"Markus"}],"citation-key":"zhouBlockchainTechnologyChemical2022","container-title":"ANNUAL REVIEW OF CHEMICAL AND BIOMOLECULAR ENGINEERING","DOI":"10.1146/annurev-chembioeng-092120-022935","ISSN":"1947-5438","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"page":"347-371","title":"Blockchain Technology in the Chemical Industry","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

To defend against attacks, the challenge is not only detecting DDoS attacks as they occur but also identifying, and thus blocking the attack flows. However, existing classification methods cannot accurately and efficiently differentiate between attack flows and benign flows. In this paper, we propose a DDoS attack flow classification system, named SAFE, to accurately and quickly identify attack flows in network layer. First, SAFE chooses the optimal features by removing the redundant features and selecting the most informative features. Second, a threshold tuning method is proposed to identify the best threshold for each feature. Finally, an aggregated feature-based linear classifier is proposed to weight the selected features for classification. Since the proposed method monitors the flows in network layer, it can detect the traditional DDoS attack flows as well as the attack flows launched by Internet of Thing (IoT) devices. Comprehensive experiments are carried out on one IoT and two sophisticated DDoS attacks to evaluate the classification performance of the proposed method. The comparison results show that SAFE can achieve better classification performance than the state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy and efficiency. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","author":[{"family":"Zhou","given":"L."},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Y."},{"family":"Zong","given":"T."},{"family":"Xiang","given":"Y."}],"citation-key":"zhouFeatureSelectionbasedMethod2022","container-title":"Future Generation Computer Systems","DOI":"10.1016/j.future.2022.02.006","ISSN":"0167739X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"language":"English","page":"67-79","title":"A feature selection-based method for DDoS attack flow classification","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125256872&doi=10.1016%2fj.future.2022.02.006&partnerID=40&md5=8cd214844155973c7307d6e3913b1c23","volume":"132"},
  {"id":"zhouReviewBlockchainApplication2018","abstract":"Internet of Things (IoT) is a network that connects lots of smart devices around the world. As a revolutionary technology, it has been developing rapidly in recent years. This paper summarizes the obstacles of IoT in terms of security and efficient operation network and introduces the Blockchain to solve these problems. Nowadays, many IoT application use the traditional central structure and collect all data in one center node. However, with connected devices on the rise, it is required that the center node should have a huge computing power, storage space and bandwidth, thus making the operation cost become higher. For IoT, another focus is all about private and security. All transaction data are stored in the third party, which means hackers can break security barriers and steal user information easily. Moreover, some businessmen will sell user information to other parties without owner's authorization. Through this paper we find that Blockchain can provide a distributed, transparent platform with trustless mechanism and collective maintenance of security for the IoT. But, applying Blockchain directly to IoT may result in many problems, such as limited resource, longer delays, poor scalability. At present, there is not a Blockchain model which can be applied in large scale IoT networks. The future study can be followed along this line.","author":[{"family":"Zhou","given":"Qin"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Yaming"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Jinlian"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Mingzhe"}],"citation-key":"zhouReviewBlockchainApplication2018","collection-title":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science","container-title":"CLOUD COMPUTING AND SECURITY, PT V","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-00018-9_64","editor":[{"family":"Sun","given":"X"},{"family":"Pan","given":"Z"},{"family":"Bertino","given":"E"}],"ISBN":"978-3-030-00018-9 978-3-030-00017-2","ISSN":"0302-9743","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"page":"724-733","publisher":"Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol; Springer; Hainan Univ; IEEE Nanjing Chapter; ACM China; Michigan State Univ; Taiwan Cheng Kung Univ; Taiwan Dong Hwa Univ; Providence Univ; Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut; State Key Lab Integrated Serv Networks; Tech Sci Press; Natl Nat Sci Fdn China","title":"Review on Blockchain Application for Internet of Things","type":"paper-conference","volume":"11067"},
