### ℹ Background information, Prerequisites

> [!quote|blue]+ Highlight ([page. 1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6JAZ9PYL?page=1&annotation=YIVKZ9XF))
> Therefore, existing security methods should be enhanced to secure the IoT ecosystem effectively. Machine learning and deep learning (ML/DL) have advanced considerably over the last few years, and machine intelligence has transitioned from laboratory curiosity to practical machinery in several important application 

### ❓ Assumptions, Questions, Goals, Problems

> [!quote|green]+ Highlight ([page. 1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6JAZ9PYL?page=1&annotation=2T8ZCWSL))
> Implementing security measures, such as encryption, authentication, access control, network security and application security, for IoT devices and their inherent vulnerabilities is ineffective. 

### 📊 Main findings, Results, Conclusions

> [!quote|purple]+ Highlight ([page. 1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6JAZ9PYL?page=1&annotation=VE2FSMCN))
> The ability to monitor IoT devices intelligently provides a significant solution to new or zero-day attacks. ML/DL are powerful methods of data exploration for learning about ‘normal’ and ‘abnormal’ behaviour according to how IoT components and devices perform within the IoT environment 

### 🧪Experimental details or Methods

> [!quote|red]+ Highlight ([page. 1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6JAZ9PYL?page=1&annotation=498AGZW9))
> On the one hand, IoT technologies play a crucial role in enhancing several real-life smart applications that can improve life quality. On the other hand, the crosscutting nature of IoT systems and the multidisciplinary components involved in the deployment of such systems have introduced new security challenges. 

### ⭐ Interesting point, Facts, Examples

> [!quote|yellow]+ Highlight ([page. 1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6JAZ9PYL?page=1&annotation=V6W52G2C))
> The Internet of Things (IoT) integrates billions of smart devices that can communicate with one another with minimal human intervention. It is one of the fastest developing fields in the history of computing, with an estimated 50 billion devices by the end of 2020

### 📄 Important references

> [!quote|magenta]+ Highlight ([page. 1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6JAZ9PYL?page=1&annotation=BSZYPE6I))
> Consequently, ML/DL methods are important in transforming the security of IoT systems from merely facilitating secure communication between devices to security-based intelligence systems 

> [!quote|magenta]+ Highlight ([page. 1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6JAZ9PYL?page=1&annotation=T4KTJ8TN))
> The goal of this work is to provide a comprehensive survey of ML methods and recent advances in DL methods that can be used to develop enhanced security methods for IoT systems. IoT security threats that are related to inherent or newly introduced threats are presented, and various potential IoT system attack surfaces and the possible threats related to each surface are discussed
