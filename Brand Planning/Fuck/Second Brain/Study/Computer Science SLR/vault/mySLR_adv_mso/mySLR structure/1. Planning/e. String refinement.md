The idea is to test the string defined in the previous item in one of the search engines (for example, Scopus). Once the string is performed, verify if the returned papers appear to be relevant. Known papers that are potential candidates for primary studies of this review (which exist on these engines) should appear in the search. If no relevant results appear, the search string must be parsed again to be calibrated. 

The refinement of the search criteria in each database (search by title, abstract and keywords or complete, limitation or not per year, limitation or not by area, etc.) should be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. 

Figure 1 shows the example of a search string being created on the Scopus database.
