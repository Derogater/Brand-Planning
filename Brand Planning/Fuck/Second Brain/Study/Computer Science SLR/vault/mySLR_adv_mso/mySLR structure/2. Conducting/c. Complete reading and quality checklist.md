In this last stage, quality criteria (checklist) should be defined to verify the suitability of the papers analyzed. Besides the checklist, it is interesting to set a cut-off point so that less-qualified papers (according to the defined checklist) can be deleted. The lead author should do all the initial work (reading all articles, applying the checklist, deleting the articles below the cutoff point). This stage should be guided by the advisors.
