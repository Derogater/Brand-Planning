Once the search string is defined, it must be adapted to each of the search engines, since the syntax used by each one is different. It is always interesting to keep in a document what string was used, how many articles each base returned, and the date of execution. If it is necessary to run the search again (either by the author or by a researcher who intends to continue the work), you can execute the complete string or restrict to the period that the initial execution succeeds, just complementing the results.
