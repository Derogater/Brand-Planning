At this stage, the research questions should be answered by analyzing the papers selected in the previous step. You can create a spreadsheet with the papers (title or ID) in the rows and the query questions in the columns. Then, when proceeding with the reading of the articles, the possible answers extracted may be posted directly to the spreadsheet. 

The synthesis of the extracted data can be presented in different forms. Usually, tables, graphs and other artifacts are used to facilitate the visualization of this information. This step can be performed in conjunction with the previous step.
