## Define your research question and inclusion/exclusion criteria for selecting relevant literature

> üî• [[Example Define Research]]

Defining your research question and inclusion/exclusion criteria for selecting relevant literature is an important step in conducting a systematic literature review (SLR). In Obsidian, you can use the following tips to help you with this process:

- To define your research question, you can use the framework, which stands for Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome. This helps you to specify the main components of your research question and make it clear and focused. You can create a note in Obsidian with the title ‚ÄúResearch Question‚Äù and write down your [[PICO]] elements in bullet points. For example:
    
    - Population: Entrepreneurs in developing countries
        
    - Intervention: Microfinance
        
    - Comparison: No microfinance or other forms of financing
        
    - Outcome: Business performance and social impact
        
    - Research Question: How does microfinance affect the business performance and social impact of entrepreneurs in developing countries?
        
- To define your inclusion/exclusion criteria, you can use the framework, which adds Study design to the PICO elements. This helps you to determine which types of studies are relevant and eligible for your SLR. You can create another note in Obsidian with the title ‚ÄúInclusion/Exclusion Criteria‚Äù and write down your PICOS elements in bullet points. For example:
    
    - Population: Entrepreneurs in developing countries
        
    - Intervention: Microfinance
        
    - Comparison: No microfinance or other forms of financing
        
    - Outcome: Business performance and social impact
        
    - Study design: Empirical studies (quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods) published in peer-reviewed journals or conference proceedings in English
        
    - Inclusion Criteria: Studies that meet all the PICOS elements
        
    - Exclusion Criteria: Studies that do not meet any of the PICOS elements, or that are duplicates, reviews, editorials, commentaries, or book chapters
        
- To link your notes and create a hierarchy, you can use the plugin, which allows you to create nested lists and drag and drop notes within them. You can create a parent note in Obsidian with the title ‚ÄúSLR Project‚Äù and use the Outliner plugin to create a list of sub-notes, such as ‚ÄúResearch Question‚Äù, ‚ÄúInclusion/Exclusion Criteria‚Äù, ‚ÄúLiterature Search‚Äù, ‚ÄúLiterature Analysis‚Äù, and ‚ÄúLiterature Synthesis‚Äù. You can then link your existing notes to the corresponding sub-notes using the [[double brackets]] syntax. For example:
    
    - SLR Project
        - [[Research Question]]
        - [[Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria]]
        - [[Literature Search]]
        - [[Literature Analysis]]
        - [[Literature Synthesis]]
