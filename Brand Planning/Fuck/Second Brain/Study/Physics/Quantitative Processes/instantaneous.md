For a [[physical quantities]] that is a [[function]] of [[obsidian-master/obsidian-master/College/Definitions/time]], $y=f(t)$ the instantaneous version is defined, 

#### [[phenomenology]]
- By simple [[experiment or measurement]], typically a change can be measured by taking two measurements at two [[obsidian-master/obsidian-master/College/Definitions/time]] [[instant]], and computing an [[average]].

$${dy(t) \over dt}=f'(t)=\lim_{h\rightarrow0}{f(t-h)-f(t)\over h}$$
