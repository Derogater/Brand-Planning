#C33-7
A type of [[physical quantities]] that arises in [[Huygen's principle]] for the analysis of a [[notebook-main/physics/Wave]], such that at each point on a [[wavefront]] can be broken down into another [[notebook-main/physics/Wave]] with a circular wavefront propagating at the [[wave speed]] of the emitter.
