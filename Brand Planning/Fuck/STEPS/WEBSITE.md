MY WEBSITE IS WWW.ANTIANIM.COM, WHICH IS A MANGA READING WEBSITE, WHICH IS 75% AUTOMATIC AND WORKS VERY GOOD BUT HAVE LOOKS AND FEELS LIKE IT'S IN 1980'S, HAHAHA.

WELL THE GOAL OF THIS WEBSITE IS TO CREATE A COMMUNITY OF LIKE MINDED PERSON'S, AND THE COMMUNITY WILL BE ABLE TO CREATE A NETWORK OF INFORMATION, RESOURCES AND SERVICES TO EACH OTHER WITHOUT THE BOUNDRIES OF ANY KIND OF DISCRIMATION TO EACH OTHER.

BUT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING REGARDING THE LOOKS AND AUTOMATION OF THE WEBSITE SOON AND ALSO NEED TO WORK ON THE EXPENDATION OF THE COMMUNITY AND WEBSITE DESTRIBUTION.
