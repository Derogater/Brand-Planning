In the Stoic perspective, love is embraced as a natural and enriching part of life, yet it is approached with rationality and self-control. Stoicism teaches that love should foster personal growth and virtue, advocating for a balanced affection that contributes positively to one’s life without leading to excessive attachment or dependency. It encourages loving with a generous spirit, without the expectation of return, and accepting the impermanence of relationships as part of the natural order.  
By applying Stoic wisdom, one can love deeply yet freely, appreciating the present while being prepared for life’s inevitable changes.


#### THE ROMANTIC LOVE IS A MODERN DAY INVENTION, MOST PEOPLE WOULD'T FALL IN LOVE IF THEY NEVER HEARD OF IT. CURRENT LOVE IS WHAT BIG CORPORATIONS PEDAL & WHEN WE THINK ABOUT ALL THE FLOWERS AND CHOCOLATES, THE MOVIES, THE LOVE SONGS, COME ON, ROMANTIC LOVE IS A PRODUCT OF CAPITALISM.
