1:2 RR

1:3 RR

EVERY SINGLE TIME


















To break down and understand the trading strategy mentioned in the comment, here's a step-by-step guide:  
1. **Wake up before NY session open**:  
- The New York session typically starts at 8 AM EST. Wake up early enough to prepare and analyze the market before this session begins.  
2. **Drop in to some higher timeframes**:  
- Higher timeframes such as 1-hour, 4-hour, or daily charts help to identify the overall market trend and key support and resistance levels.  
3. **Determine a bias**:  
- Based on the higher timeframe analysis, determine whether the market is in an uptrend (bullish bias) or downtrend (bearish bias).  
4. **Go to lower timeframes**:  
- Switch to lower timeframes such as 15-minute or 5-minute charts to look for entry points that align with the higher timeframe trend.  
5. **Look for some SMT (Smart Money Techniques), divergence, and inverse fair value gap**:  
- **Smart Money Techniques (SMT)**: Look for patterns or signals that indicate the actions of institutional traders.  
- **Divergence**: Look for divergence between the price and an indicator (e.g., RSI or MACD) to spot potential reversals.  
- **Inverse fair value gap**: Identify areas where the price might retrace to fill gaps created by rapid moves.  
6. **Retrace in, tap in - that's his entry**:  
- Wait for the price to retrace to a key level (support or resistance) or a fair value gap and then enter the trade.  
7. **Target some resting liquidity**:  
- Resting liquidity refers to areas where orders are likely to be filled, such as previous highs or lows. Set your target at these levels to take profit.  
8. **Aim for a 1:2 or 1:3 risk/reward ratio every time, with a 70% win rate**:  
- Ensure your trades have a favorable risk/reward ratio (e.g., risking $1 to make $2 or $3). Strive for a 70% win rate by consistently following your strategy.











This guys goes to look at price at a given hour in the day , it start to look for cluster of price variation of Â«Â long timeframeÂ Â» about hours representation of price moving  
  
Out of his ass depending on how nice price move et decide if he want to sell or buy at that price  
  
He then go on lower timeframe to see price variation on a minute timeframe  
  
and there on a none centrailized market he draw little nice boxes on price to put spot weâ€™re he would buy or sell  
  
With a target in wich he would resell higher or repurchase lower the price and hedge a profit  
  
From his saying (of course trust bro this guy definitely legit ðŸ«£ðŸ«£) his making from 2 dollar for 1 dollar risk to even more dollar made  
  
With an accuracy of 70%  
(Wich just not gonna happen that would be a sharpe ration above 4 so full of crap)
