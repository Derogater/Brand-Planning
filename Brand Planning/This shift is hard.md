When society is set up to teach kids that all of their childhood is really just the runner up to what job they’ll have.  
  
They learn that profession/job = identity and worth.  
  
We are conditioned to believe that the most important part of being a kid is figuring out what we will “be” or what job we will have.  
  
But what about what they ARE now?  
  
What kind of adults would come from kids who were celebrated and honored for exactly who they were BEFORE their identity was tied to a job or profession?  
  
Here are 5 questions you can ask instead of “what do you want to be when you grow up”:  
  
1. How would you change the world for better if you could?  
  
2. What do you know how to do that you can teach others?  
  
3. Of all the things you’re learning, what do you think will be the most helpful when you’re an adult?  
  
4. If you could grow up to be famous, what would you want to be famous for?  
  
5. What do you think your life will be like in the future.
