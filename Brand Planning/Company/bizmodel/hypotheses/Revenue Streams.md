Revenue streams areÂ the various sources from which a business earns money from the sale of goods or the provision of services. In a business model, revenue streams are the building blocks that represent the cash a company generates from each customer segment. A business model also distinguishes revenues resulting from one-time customer payments from recurring revenues where ongoing payments deliver a value proposition or after-sales services to a customer.

**Types of Revenue Streams**

There are several types of revenue streams, including:

- **Transaction-based revenue**: One-time payments for a specific product or service.
- **Recurring revenue**: Ongoing payments for a product or service, such as subscription-based models.
- **Project revenue**: Revenue generated from a specific project or contract.
- **Service revenue**: Revenue generated from providing services, such as consulting or maintenance.
- **Asset sales**: Revenue generated from the sale of assets, such as property or equipment.
- **Licensing**: Revenue generated from licensing intellectual property, such as patents or trademarks.
- **Advertising**: Revenue generated from advertising, such as display ads or sponsored content.
- **Brokerage fees**: Revenue generated from facilitating transactions or brokering deals.
- **Usage fees**: Revenue generated from charging customers for the use of a product or service, such as data storage or computing power.
