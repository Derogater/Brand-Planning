# Comparison of Limited Liability Company (LLC) and Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) laws in India

In India, both Limited Liability Company (LLC) and Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) are popular business structures that provide limited liability protection to their owners, shielding them from personal liability for business debts and obligations and are taxed as pass-through entities, meaning that the business income is taxed at the individual level, rather than at the corporate level. However, there are key differences between the two.

Some key features of an LLP include:

- Limited liability protection for each partner, If a partner in an LLP is legally liable for something, the other partners cannot be held jointly liable.
- Flexibility in management and decision-making. LLPs can have an unlimited number of partners, and the partners can be individuals or companies.
- Tax benefits, such as pass-through taxation,  LLP's are treated strictly as partnerships, and the partners pay taxes only on the earnings passed to them though the business.
- Ability to raise capital through partnerships with other businesses or investors
- Protection of personal assets in the event of business debts or lawsuits
- An LLP is subjected just to Income Tax and Alternate Minimum Tax.
- Once profit is declared and tax is paid by LLP, the distributed income is tax-free in the hands of the partners.
- Annual compliance in the case of LLP consists of a presentation of statement of account and solvency along with annual report u/s 34(2) and 35(1) respectively of the LLP Act.
- **Low Cost:** The registration cost for an LLP is relatively low compared to a private limited company.
- **Perpetual Succession:** The LLP continues to exist even after the death or retirement of a partner.
- **Easy to Set Up:** The process of setting up an LLP is relatively straightforward and can be done quickly.
- **Limited Transferability:** The transfer of ownership in an LLP is restricted, making it difficult to transfer shares or interests.
- **No Tax Benefits:** LLPs do not enjoy the same tax benefits as private limited companies, such as depreciation and tax exemptions. For LLPs, Tax is payable @30% and the amount of income tax to be increased by 12% as surcharge in case, total income exceeds Rs. 1 crore. Whereas private companies are taxed @22% and if income exceeds a certain amount then the surcharge is also applicable. Also, in both LLPs and companies 4% Health and Education cess is levied on the total tax payable. Taxation: Companies are taxed at a flat rate, while LLPs are taxed based on the profits and losses of the partners.
- **Higher Penalty:** The penalty for non-compliance is higher for LLPs compared to private limited companies.
- **Limited Foreign Investment:** Foreign companies and individuals can invest in LLPs, but government approval is required.
- **No External Commercial Borrowing:** LLPs cannot raise External Commercial Borrowing (ECB) or take loans from foreign partners, FIIs, or banks outside India.
- **Limited Professional Services:** LLPs are not suitable for professional services like law, medicine, or accounting, as they require a specific license or registration.
- **Higher Audit Requirements:** LLPs are required to undergo a more rigorous audit process compared to private limited companies.


Some key features of an LLC include:

- Limited Liability: Investors are protected against business debts, as the company is treated as a separate entity.
- Flexibility: LLCs can be structured to suit the needs of the business, with flexible ownership and management structures.
- Tax Benefits: LLCs are taxed as partnerships, with tax benefits such as pass-through taxation and reduced tax rates.
- Simplified Compliance: LLCs have fewer compliance requirements compared to private limited companies.

**Differences:**

- **Formation & Formation:** LLCs are not recognized in India, and therefore, cannot be formed in the country. LLPs, on the other hand, are recognized and can be formed in India by filing the necessary documents with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. There are a few differences in the formation of an LLC and LLP. Both are formed through articles of organization or articles of formation, and each usually is run based on an operating agreement. The differences are in how the members or partners buy in, sell out and add or remove members or partners. Another difference is what percentage of control or voting share each member or partner is given. For example, if a company has two principal members when it forms, each would likely be given a 50 percent share. But if another principal buys in with an equal share, the two existing members would sell a total of 33 percent of the firm to the new principal so all have equitable shares of 33 percent. Or if a principal retires in a three-person company, the existing two members would buy the shares, or the retiring principal would sell his shares to a new incoming member.
- **Taxation:** LLPs are taxed as partnerships,  with the partners being taxed individually, with the partners reporting their share of income on their personal tax returns. LLCs, if formed in a country that recognizes them, would be taxed as corporations, with the business income taxed at the corporate level.
- **Liability:** Both LLCs and LLPs provide limited liability protection to their owners. However, in an LLP, the liability of the partners is limited to the extent of their contribution to the partnership, whereas in an LLC, the liability of the members is limited to the extent of their investment in the company.
- **Management:** In an LLP, partners have the flexibility to manage the business directly, the partners have equal say in the management of the business, whereas in an LLC, management is typically done by the directors, the management structure can be customized to suit the needs of the business.
- **Regulations:** LLPs are regulated by the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008, whereas LLCs are regulated by the Companies Act, 2013, in India.
- **Compliance**: LLCs have more stringent compliance requirements compared to LLPs, which have fewer compliance requirements.
- **Ownership**: In an LLC, ownership is determined by the shareholding of the members, while in an LLP, ownership is based on the partnership agreement.

In conclusion, while both LLC and LLP offer limited liability protection, the key differences lie in their formation, taxation, liability, management, and regulations. If you are considering forming a business in India, an LLP may be a suitable option, whereas if you are considering forming a business in a country that recognizes LLCs, an LLC may be a better choice.
