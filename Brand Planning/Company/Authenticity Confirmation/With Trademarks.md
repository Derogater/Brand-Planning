## What is a Trademark?

A trademark is a unique symbol, name, logo, or slogan that distinguishes your goods or services from others in the market. It is a powerful tool for brand recognition and helps build consumer trust. Registering a trademark provides legal protection, preventing others from using your mark without your permission. Trademarks can include words, phrases, symbols, designs, or a combination of these elements.

## What is a Trademark Class?

Trademarks are categorized into various classes based on the type of goods or services they represent. The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) established a classification system called the Nice Classification. This system comprises 45 Trademark classes, each representing a specific category of goods or services. Assigning your trademark to the correct class is crucial for effective protection and registration.
