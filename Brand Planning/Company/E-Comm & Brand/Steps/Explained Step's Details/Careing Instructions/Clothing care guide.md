#### **CARE FOR YOUR CLOTHING**

> TAKING CARE OF YOUR CLOTHES IS TAKING CARE OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE BEST WAY TO LENGTHEN THEIR USEFUL LIFE. WITH THIS CLOTHING CARE GUIDE WE WANT TO HELP YOU EXTEND THE LIFESPAN OF YOUR GARMENTS AND REDUCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF CARE PROCESSES. WITH THIS YOU WILL BE ABLE TO MINIMIZE CLOTHING WEAR AND TEAR AND THE AMOUNT OF WATER AND ENERGY USED WHEN WASHING, DRYING, AND CARING FOR YOUR CLOTHES.


FULL LOADS AND GENTLE SPINS
![[1st.mp4]]
Every wash consumes water and energy. Washing at a lower temperature is gentler on clothes, doesn't cause shrinkage, prevents color fading, and uses less energy.


LINE-DRY CLOTHING
![[2nd.mp4]]

Dryers use a lot of energy. Line drying your clothes instead of machine drying them helps care for them by reducing fabric wear and tear, producing fewer wrinkles, preventing shrinkage and pilling, and it doesn't require any energy at all.


AIR OUT YOUR CLOTHES
![[3rd.mp4]]
Hang up your clothes to freshen them up. Washing your clothes will wear out fabric little by little while also using water and energy. Sometimes all your clothing needs is to be aired out or brushed down to make it like new again.


TURN YOUR CLOTHES INSIDE OUT
![[4th.mp4]]

Turn your clothes inside out to keep them from experiencing so much wear and tear during the washing process. This helps prevent color fading and protects the fabric to maintain the item's original quality.

KNITWEAR CARE
![[5th.mp4]]

Knit garments are elastic and can loose their shape when placed on hangers. To prevent any warping of the garment, dry flat and then store folded in your wardrobe. To help knits maintain their elasticity, hand wash or wash on a delicate cycle.


PILLING
![[6th.mp4]]

Pilling is the formation of small balls on fibers such as wool or cotton. It happens easily, however it is not a reason to throw out a garment. You can reduce it by turning the garment inside out before washing it or remove it by using an electric lint remover.


CLEAN YOUR SNEAKERS
![[7th.mp4]]
If you are in the habit of cleaning your sneakers once in a while, you know they will last longer and you will avoid creating more waste which has an environmental impact. You can clean them by hand with soap and water, using a small brush for difficult spots.

DRY CLEAN
![[8th.mp4]]
If you need to professionally dry clean your clothes, try to find a dry cleaner that offers a "wet cleaning" service, for those items that can withstand it, or dry cleaning systems that use technologies that are more respectful of the environment.


LEATHER AND ACCESSORIES
![[9th.mp4]]
Leather is sturdy but delicate. Avoid humidity, heat, chemical products or rain, as all of these can damage it. Use a slightly damp cloth to remove light stains, and for more difficult stains, go to a dry cleaner. If leather gets wet, allow it to air dry. For other accessories, clean them regularly with a cotton cloth or soft brush, and use environmentally friendly cleaning products.


REPAIR
![[10th.mp4]]
To lengthen the useful life of your clothing, you can opt to do small mending yourself, like sewing on buttons, fixing seams or small holes. If you cannot do it yourself, go to a professional.

RESALE
![[11th.mp4]]
When you have items from ZARA that you no longer use, you can decide to resell them. Someone other than you could use them.
	
FINALLY, RECYCLE
![[12th.mp4]]
Once you no longer wear your clothes, don't throw them out. You can bring them to our stores and give them a new life.
