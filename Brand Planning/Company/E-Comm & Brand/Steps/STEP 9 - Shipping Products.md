How to Ship Clothes: 

Staying competitive as an apparel retailer isnâ€™t just about selling great clothes.

Fashion retailers also need to master the logistics ecosystem of shipping clothes and understand how factors like box size, item weight, as well as speed and distance of travel affect shipping costs.

Many clothing retailers operate on razor-thin margins, which is why you need to know theÂ cheapest wayÂ toÂ ship items to customers efficiently.

In this article, youâ€™ll discover how to ship clothes, learn more about the major shipping options, and get a look at the intricacies of international shipping.

Factors to consider when shipping clothes ðŸ‘—


Clothes are easy to ship, and below are the factors you need to master to ensure your shipments will always get to customers without a hitch.

Packaging and marketing


Packaging protects the product and helps in identifying and promoting your brand. Effective packaging can also reduce costs and enhance theÂ unboxing experience.

Packaging and marketing work hand in hand because the customer's unboxing experience influences how your brand is perceived. Clothes must be neatly folded before they are packed into mailers. Use packaging inserts and an attractive presentation to set your brand apart and create a pleasant experience for customers.

Shipping companies


Youâ€™re likely already familiar with the major carriers: USPS, UPS, and FedEx. Shipping options and pricing vary from carrier to carrier.

To select the right one, consider the following:

Destination address: do you ship clothes to customers domestically, internationally, or both?
Package weight: what is your most common package weight? What are your minimum and maximum package weights?
Delivery speed: what is your ideal speed of delivery? Do your customers require weekend delivery?
Service options: do your customers require tracking and delivery confirmation? Does the carrier provide free supplies like boxes, envelopes, and labels?
Insurance: whatâ€™s your average order value? Will you need insurance? Does your carrierâ€™s included insurance cover it? Will you need additional insurance?

You should evaluate each carrier within the context of the factors listed above to select the best option for your store.

Shipping rates


Your shipping rate is how much you charge to customers for shipping costs, and your pricing strategy will influence your shipping rates. There are three options you can choose from:

Real-time carrier rate: you can let your customers choose and pay for the exact shipping option they want by setting up real-time carrier rates.
Flat Rate: this is a popular option and here you charge a flat rate for all shipments. This may not be effective if you sell a variety of clothing, but it works when you have a standard product line.
Free shipping: customers love this, but someone needs to pay for it. You can increase product prices to cover the cost of shipping or pay the full price from your margins. You can offset costs by limiting free shipping to an order amount.

How to package clothes for shipping


Clothes are not fragile products, so you don't have to worry about breakage during transit.Â Standard mailersÂ will do fine for single, small-piece clothing, andÂ padded mailersÂ are best for delicate clothing with trinkets or buttons attached.



You will need cardboard boxes or corrugated boxes for large clothing shipments to the same destination. Seal each cloth with aÂ Compostable Garment BagÂ to prevent them from getting wet in transit and useÂ high-quality packing tape.

Stick with smaller boxes as much as possible to reduce shipping costs. For clothes like jeans with a package weight heavier than others, use flat rate shipping to ship your clothes, since weight won't factor into your shipping costs.



You can use your own branded packaging or order free packaging from your carrier. It's a good idea to useÂ Recycled MailersÂ and label your packaging as such in this age of eco-conscious buyers.

When packing clothes for shipping you must consider the clothing type and other details to ensure neat product presentation, control costs, protect sensitive clothing, and make the most of your shipping. Here is how to package different types of clothing:

Packing a single shirt:
Fold it neatly and place it face down with the sleeves folded backward.
Place it in a bag or wrap it withÂ tissue paperÂ and seal it with a piece of tape or ticker. Then place it in the poly mailer.
Finally, add theÂ shipping labelÂ and input all relevant information.


Packing multiple shirts:
Stack the shirts and use a box or mailer thatâ€™s larger than the volume of the clothes to prevent wrinkling
It's best if you use packaging thatâ€™s made with a material that can prevent wrinkling
Add the shipping label.


Packing single pants or jeans:
Fold the pant legs on top of one another, then fold once from the knees to the pockets. Next, fold the jeans in half one more time.
Place the jeans in a bag or wrap it with tissue paper then seal it. Place it into the poly mailer.
Add theÂ shipping label.

Packing multiple pants or jeans:
Stack the jeans and use aÂ Padded MailerÂ to prevent wrinkling
Seal the mailer
Add the shipping label.

Packing delicate clothing:
Use a box that is slightly larger than the volume of the clothes to contain it without squishing
Place the item inside theÂ boxÂ and wrap it withÂ tissue paper
Add cushioning material to further protect the delicate details of the fabric
Add the shipping label.

Saving money with your packaging


You should pack clothes with shipping costs in mind, and here are a few tips to help you lower costs:

Fold each cloth carefully before placing it in your mailer
Always try to use the smallest package possible
Weigh packages as you pack to adjust and ensure accuracy
Avoid extra cushioning unless when shipping delicate fabrics
Use inexpensiveÂ poly mailers
Ship items together
Look for volume discounts on large shipments.

How to determine shipment weight


The weight of your package, among other factors, determines shipment pricing. You must always get the package weight right to avoid overpaying and reduce costs. Here are two easy ways you can determine package weight:

Use a cooking scale for smaller items like single shirts
Use a bathroom scale for larger items like multiple jeans.

How to ship clothes to customers


Below, we will explain the process of shipping items using the major carriers and the options available to you.

Shipping clothes through USPS


USPS is the best option for shipping lightweight items. You can leverage volume discounts and use flat rate shipping when you are delivering heavier items or sending to a distant recipient.

USPS offers multiple shipping options but the most relevant are First Class Mail and Priority Mail shipping.

First Class mail shipping


This is the cheapest option, and it is for light packages that weigh 13 ounces or less. If the standard package weight of your clothing orders falls within this range, it's very cost effective to use First Class mail for most shipments.

The amount you are charged is determined based on the shipping distance. Use your zip code to understand how it is calculated using the USPSÂ Domestic Zone Chart.

Priority Mail shipping


This is flat rate shipping for packages over 13 ounces, and shipments are delivered within 1-3 business days. There is a maximum package limit of 70lbs.

Shipping cost is determined by package dimensions and package weight or shipment distance.

USPS also offers variable pricing for time-sensitive shipments. Use theÂ rate calculatorÂ to determine your shipping costs.

Shipping clothes through FedEx


Shipping through FedEx is another option. The shipping company offers a wide range of shipping services including flat rate shipping, freight shopping, same-day delivery, and overnight shipping.

Pricing depends on package weight, distance, and the shipping option you selected.

Flat rate shipping: this applies to packages that weigh 50lbs or less. It is the cheapest option and your package weight will not influence pricing as long as it's under 50lbs.
Freight Shipping: this applies to packages above 150lbs
Same-day delivery: for delivering time-sensitive packages across the country within hours.

Use theÂ FedEx shipping rate calculatorÂ to get shipping cost estimates.

Shipping clothes through UPS


UPS is another carrier worth considering and the shipping company is a very good option if you want flexibility with your shipping.

UPS offers variable pricing and you can set package weights, distance, speed, and other parameters to determine shipping costs. This is particularly ideal for shipping special items like wedding dresses that do not have standardized package weights.

Flat rate shipping from UPSÂ is limited to 50lbs per box and takes 1-5 days to ship. You will use your own packaging and there are five different options based on package weight.

Use theÂ UPS Time and Cost toolÂ to calculate shipping cost estimates.

What is the cheapest way to ship clothes?


To determine the best way to ship clothes to customers, you must examine how many items you plan to ship, as well as the speed and distance of travel. Compare prices from different carriers using rate calculators to discover the best option.

USPS First Class Mail is the cheapest option for shipping clothes if you are shipping a lightweight package. The downside is that there is no customer tracking and time-frames can be unpredictable.

For larger packages, use flat rate shipping options. Package weight can be moved up to as much as 70lbs and there are often discounts on large shipping volumes.

Shipping clothes internationally


To get international shipping right and grow your business, you need to have an effective strategy that works for your business in place.

Here are a few factors to consider when shipping clothes internationally:

The destination of your shipment


The world is a big place and you must first identify the countries you want to ship to. You can ship only to North American countries like Canada and Mexico that have free trade agreements (FTA) with the U.S. which makes it easier to ship to those countries.

Countries like Australia, Singapore, Costa Rica, and others alsoÂ have free trade agreements in place. This will simplify custom clearance and lower duty rates. If you are shipping to countries without an FTA, you need to familiarize yourself with the countries regulations and duty rates.

Country rules and regulations


The rules and regulations of the destination country are important when evaluating if your product is eligible to be imported. Clothing is rarely prohibited, but it's worth checking out whether the clothing type you are exporting is allowed.

Use the government site of the host country to get information on prohibited items, and you can also use the UPSÂ Import/Export Country Regulations toolÂ for your research.

Customs paperwork


Commercial Invoice and Export Packing List are typically the two documents required. Commercial Invoice is used for shipment classification by custom authorities and to assess whether controls are imposed on the product.

The Export Packing List details extensive information about the product, including the shipper, buyer, invoice number, shipment date, and more.

FedEx has anÂ International Shipping Assistant ToolÂ that can help to put together the correct documentation to clear customs.

You can upload and submit the paperwork electronically on the platform of all the major carriers.

Duties and taxes


If you are shipping to a country without an FTA with the U.S., duties, and taxes are usually imposed on exports. It is determined by the value of your item, your country of origin, and the type of item you are shipping.

By default, the customer pays the duties on the package you are shipping, but you can choose the shipper (you) or another third party to pay the charges when creating your shipment on the platform of your carrier.

Use anÂ online duty calculatorÂ to get a cost estimate of the duties and taxes that apply in the destination country.

International shipping label


You must prepare an international shipping label for your shipment.

You can complete the international shipping label when uploading other custom paperwork on the platform of your carrier. Add an accurate description of the type, quantity, and value of the clothes you are shipping to ensure easy custom clearance.

International shipping options


All the major carriers offer international shipping with flexible shipping services for time-sensitive shipments.

USPS International Shipping: offers First Class Mail International, Priority Mail International, and Airmail M-Bags shipping services.
FedEx International Shipping: ship easily from FedEx locations and use the many tools on the companyâ€™s website to make your shipping process accurate and efficient.
UPS International Shipping: the company offers standard and time-critical international shipping services. Check the website to create your shipment online.
