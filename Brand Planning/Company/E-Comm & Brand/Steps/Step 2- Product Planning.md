 1. First problem is that Apparels are getting too Expensive, due to this, people are not able to buy good Quality Products. Secondly, People are getting Sick and tired due to the use of Synthetic Fibers which are dead fibers and block the the natural aura(Electromagnetic Files of the human body). these are for everybody like Children, Adults and Old People too. these issues have be going on since late 1990’s when people started mass producing Synthetic Fibers and are controlling the prices in the name of false “Brand” term, actually these products are created only at the fraction of the actual price at which they are sold.
2. We have not the feedback of it as our own but we are working on it. As for the Research, it has been conducted many times and are easily available over the internet.
3. Well these problems and experiences are based on the general opinions of the public as we as the author of this page had also faced these same problem personally. to solve these problems we are closely working with a local community to see ourself if the results are positive or not, author is also part of this program( and is bound to provide the actual experience that he felt).
4. Even on a global scale, people are facing health and economic issues. and corporates(Private as well as Govt.) are not able to solve these problems but are actively suppressing these issues just as a symptom which is not helping people at all and are bound to effect the masses all over the globe eventually. We want the people to know that that cost of clothing is not as high as they have been charged and also that their cloths are also directly connected to the health issues of the masses.
