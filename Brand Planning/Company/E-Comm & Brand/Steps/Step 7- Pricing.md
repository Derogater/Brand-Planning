This is the pricing at which we will sell a product to get our profit.

For this we need to calculate all the below Expenses and then add our profit margin to get the price which we can/should sell on.

[[Procurement price]]
[[Logistics]]
[[Storage]]
[[Step 8- Branding the Product]]
[[Commission]]
[[Tax]]
[[Return Order]]
[[Distribution]]
[[Profit Margin]]

> **a general calculation is performed in case we go along with an e-comm platform such as amazon, flipkart or myntra:-**



product sale price= 500

commission= 10%=50
shipping= 80 (avg weight of item is less then 500g)
fixed closing fee= 30
total=160

TOTAL gst=18%=57.6

gst on total amount=28.8

now total is 188.8


transfer price= 500-189=311

total orders= 100
return=20%

logistics is 80 for delivery and 100 for return

return= 20 * 180=3600
total sale= 80 * 311=24880

total remaining= 24880-3600=21280

clear all above it




avg. product cost=30%

cost of good sold=12000 (this is the price of 80 products, which were delivered, at which we buy them in beginning which is 150 )

total = 21280-12000 (total remaining - cost of item) = 9280

packing+ shipping= appr. 1000 for 80 products

advertisement cost (sale + marketing=5%) = (500 * 100) + gst= 2500+450= 2950 (because advertisement cost will be based on number of orders we got, which is 100 and total amount we want to sell is 50000 thus 500/product price )

# profit in hand = 9280-(1000+2950)= 5330
